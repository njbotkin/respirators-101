This mobile app aims to make the process of choosing the correct respirator easier and faster.

It is based on the NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic (RSL). Like a logic flow diagram, or a “wizard,” each question helps to narrow down the available options.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The respirator selection tool contains a series of questions to help you choose the class of respirator to use in a setting with airborne contaminants. Recommendations are based primarily on contaminants’ physical, chemical, and toxicological properties. Other considerations include filtration efficiency, air supply capability, leakage danger, and face seal characteristics.

Respirator classes are consistent with respirator certification groupings as specified in the NIOSH Guide to the Selection and Use of Particulate Respirators (Certified Under 42 CFR 84).

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[[expand title="Exposure Limits"]PEL: Permissible Exposure Limit. OSHA’s permissible exposure limits establish the maximum level of a specific airborne hazard that an employee can be exposed to, averaged over an 8-hour workday.

REL: Recommended Exposure Limit. The NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limit is a non-mandatory, recommended occupational exposure limit.The OSHA PEL is the legally enforceable regulatory limit. Employers are required to take actions to reduce worker exposures if air samples show levels above OSHA's calculated PEL. However, because OSHA recognizes that many of its PELs are outdated and inadequate measures of worker safety, both OSHA and NIOSH recommend that employers take actions to keep worker exposures below the NIOSH REL.

STEL: Short Term Exposure Limit. Short-term exposure limits are concentrations above which a worker should not be exposed, averaged over 15 minutes. Exposures cannot be repeated more than 4 times per day

TLV: Threshold Limit Value. An occupational exposure level recommended by ACGIH. TLVs are the maximum average airborne concentration of a hazardous material to which healthy adult workers can be exposed during an 8-hour workday and 40-hour workweek—over a working lifetime—without experiencing significant adverse health effects.[/expand]

[expand title="APF"]The Assigned Protection Factor (APF) indicates the workplace level of respiratory protection that a respirator or class of respirators is expected to provide to employees when the employer implements a continuing, effective respiratory protection program as specified by this section.[/expand]

[expand title="MUC"]Maximum Use Concentration (MUC) is the maximum atmospheric concentration of a hazardous substance from which an employee can be expected to be protected when wearing a respirator, and is determined by the assigned protection factor of the respirator or class of respirators and the exposure limit of the hazardous substance. The MUC can be determined mathematically by multiplying the assigned protection factor specified for a respirator by the required OSHA permissible exposure limit, short-term exposure limit, or ceiling limit. When no OSHA exposure limit is available for a hazardous substance, an employer must determine an MUC on the basis of relevant available information and informed professional judgment.[/expand]

[expand title="TWA"]Time-Weighted Average is used to measure a worker's daily exposure to hazardous substances, averaged on an 8-hour workday. The average is calculated from air samples  throughout a work cycle and the amount of time spent working in those conditions. OSHA uses TWAs to establish Permissible Exposure Limits for the contaminants encountered in industries.  The TWA is calculated in units of parts per million (ppm) or mg/m3.[/expand]

[expand title="Ceiling"]Ceiling limits are concentrations above which a worker should never be exposed.[/expand]

[expand title="Oxygen-Deficient Atmosphere"]An atmosphere with oxygen content below 19.5% by volume.Immediately Dangerous to Life or HealthAn atmosphere that poses an immediate threat to life, would cause irreversible adverse health effects, or would impair an individual’s ability to escape from a dangerous atmosphere.[/expand]

[expand title="Loose fit vs. Tight fit"]A Loose-fitting facepiece is designed to form a partial seal with the face.

A Tight-fitting facepiece forms a complete seal with the face.[/expand]

[expand title="Negative vs. Positive Pressure Systems"]Respirators operate either as:

• Negative pressure systems

• Positive pressure systems

During inhalation negative pressure respirators have lower air pressure inside the facepiece compared to the air pressure outside. If the facepiece-to-face seal leaks on these types of respirators, air contaminants will be drawn into the breathing air. All respirators without a supplied-air component are considered negative pressure respirators.

Positive pressure respirators maintain positive air pressure inside the facepiece at all times by means of supplied air. Therefore the air pressure inside the facepiece remains greater than the air pressure outside the facepiece. Thus, any leakage around the facepiece seal should result in air escaping from inside the facepiece to the outside environment rather than worksite contaminants leaking into the facepiece.[/expand]

[expand title="Filter series and Filter efficiency"]Air-purifying respirators that filter out at least 95% of airborne particles during “worst case” testing are given a 95 rating for filter efficiency. Those that filter out at least 99% receive a “99” rating. And those that filter at least 99.97% (essentially 100%) receive a “100” rating.

Air-purifying respirators are rated in a filter series as N, R, or P for protection against oils. This rating is important in industry because some industrial oils can degrade the filter performance so it doesn’t filter properly. Respirators are rated “N,” if they are Not resistant to oil, “R” if somewhat Resistant to oil, and “P” if strongly resistant (oil Proof).NIOSH uses very high standards to test and approve respirators for occupational uses. NIOSH-approved disposable respirators are marked with the manufacturer’s name, the part number (P/N), the protection provided by the filter (e.g., N-95), and “NIOSH.” This information is printed on the facepiece, exhalation valve cover, or head straps.[/expand]]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Respirators protect employees from inhaling harmful substances, including chemical, biological, and radiological agents. These may come in the form of airborne vapors, gases, dust, fogs, fumes, mists, smokes, or sprays. There are also hazards associated with oxygen deprivation.

Ordinarily, there are a wide range of engineering or workplace controls put in place to eliminate or reduce such dangers. But in some cases certain routine operations and emergency situation may require the use of personal protective equipment and/or respirators.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[[expand title="Overview"] There are 2 main categories/types of respirators:
<ol>
 	<li>Air-Purifying (e.g. particulate masks, gas/vapor masks, PAPRs)</li>
 	<li>Atmosphere-Supplying (e.g. SCBA, SAR)</li>
</ol>
<h6>Air-Purifying Respirators (or APRs)</h6>
Includes particulate masks, gas/vapor masks, and Powered Air-Purifying Respirators (PAPRs).These use filters or sorbents to remove harmful substances from the air. They range from simple disposable masks to sophisticated devices. They do not supply oxygen and must not be used in oxygen-deficient atmospheres or in other atmospheres that are immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH). Respirators in this family are rated as N, R, or P for protection against oils.

<h6>Atmosphere-Supplying Respirators</h6>
Includes supplied-air respirators (SARs) and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) units.These are designed to provide breathable air from a clean air source other than the surrounding contaminated work atmosphere.

[expand title="Particulate Respirators (APR)"]

Particulate respirators are a kind of air-purifying respirator. They filter out airborne particles, but not gases or vapors. They can also filter airborne biological agents (e.g. bacteria, viruses) since they are particles.*
Particulate respirators can either be disposable or reusable/elastomeric. They are usually rated as N, R, or P for protection against oils.
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-208" src="http://respirators101.iuoe-hazmat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/HTB1qVk5JVXXXXcKXXXXq6xXFXXXi-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />
* Selection of respirators for infectious disease and terrorism-related exposures requires consideration of additional factors in addition to the traditional exposure assessment approaches described in this guidance. See the NIOSH respirator topic page http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/respirators/ for additional information and guidance on particular infectious disease and terrorism issues.[/expand]

[expand title="Gas/Vapor Respirators (APR)"] Gas (or vapor) respirators are a kind of tight-fitting air-purifying respirator. They filter chemical gases out of the air as you breathe using cartridge filters. Cartridge filters are specialized and must be selected according to the hazards faced. There is no "all-in-one" filter that protects against everything. The filters are usually rated as N, R, or P for protection against oils.

[expand title="Combination Particulate and Gas/Vapor Respirators (APR)"]Combination respirators are a kind of <u>tight-fitting air-purifying respirator</u>. They use cartridge filter to filter out both airborne particles and gases as you breathe. Cartridge filters are specialized and must be selected according to the hazards faced. There is no "all-in-one" filter that protects against everything. The filters are usually rated as N, R, or P for protection against oils.

[expand title="PAPR (APR)"]A Powered Air-Purifying Respirator (PAPR) can filter particulates, gases, or a combination. Powered air is pulled through the filters and then pushed into the user’s facepiece. There are many varieties of PAPRs, including loose-fitting full face, tight-fitting full face, or half-mask. It can include a helmet or hood.

[expand title="SCBA"]A SCBA is a Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus. It is a kind of tight-fitting atmosphere-supplying respirator. Breathing air is supplied to the facepeice from a cylinder of compressed air. The cylinders are carried by the respirator user, often on the back. These respirators provide the highest level of respiratory protection.

[expand title="Escape Respirators"]A SAR is a Supplied-Air Respirator (or airline respirator). It is a kind of atmosphere-supplying respirator. Breathing air is supplied to the facepiece viaEscape respirators are only for emergency exits. They should allow a person working in a normally safe environment time to escape from sudden hazardous conditions. These respirators are selected based on the time needed to escape and the likelihood of IDLH or oxygen deficiency conditions, not specific APF ratings.
Escape devices can be either APRs or SCBAs.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[[expand title="Oil Characteristics"]Air-purifying respirators are rated as N, R, or P according to their protection against oils. This rating is important because some industrial oils degrade filters. Air-purifying respirators are rated as N, R, or P according to their protection against oils. This rating is important because some industrial oils degrade filters.
<ul>
 	<li>N= <strong>N</strong>ot resistant to oil</li>
 	<li>R= somewhat <strong>R</strong>esistant to oil</li>
 	<li>P= strongly resistant, or oil <strong>P</strong>roof</li>
</ul>
You will often find this letter rating alongside the percentage of particulate filtration protection that the respirator offers (usually 95%, 99%, or 99.7%). The rating would look something like, “N99” or “P95”.[/expand]

[expand title="Quarter-face, Half-face, and Full-face"]Respirators can be either:
<ul>
 	<li>Quarter-face respirators, where just the top of the nose and chin are covered</li>
 	<li>Half-face respirators, where the whole nose and down around the chin are covered</li>
 	<li>Full-face respirators, where the whole face, at least up to the hairline and down around the chin are covered. Sometimes the whole head is covered.</li>
</ul>
A full face respirator provides a higher level of protection than half-facepiece respirator because it has better sealing characteristics. Since it covers the user's eyes and face, it can also be used to protect against liquid splashes and irritating vapors.[/expand]

[expand title="Hoods and Helmets"]Eye protection is often required in addition to respiratory protection when working with airborne particles and chemicals. Full facepiece respirators are used to provide eye protection. Full-face coverage is often integrated with a hood or helmet to provide better insulation from various hazards (e.g. falling material, etc.)[/expand]

[expand title="Loose fitting vs. Tight fitting"]Respirators can be either:
<ul>
 	<li>Tight-fitting</li>
 	<li>Loose-fitting</li>
</ul>
Tight-fitting respirators create a tight seal between the respirator and the face and/or neck of the respirator user. If the respirator's seal leaks, contaminated air will be pulled into the facepiece, endangering the user. If you are required to use a tight-fitting respirator at work, you must be fit tested with the respirator selected for your use. You also must perform regular user seal checks. This check determines if the respirator is properly sealed to the face or needs to be readjusted.
Loose-fitting respirators do not depend on a tight seal with the face to provide protection. Therefore, they do not need to be fit tested.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40" src="http://respirators101.iuoe-hazmat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/OSHASAR.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="250" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39" src="http://respirators101.iuoe-hazmat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/LoosePARP.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="250" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-32" src="http://respirators101.iuoe-hazmat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/HalfFaceSAR-243x300.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="300" />

Loose fitting full-face PARPs vs. Tight fitting half-face SAR[/expand]

[expand title="Negative vs. Positive Pressure Systems"]Respirators operate either as:
<ul>
 	<li>Negative pressure systems</li>
 	<li>Positive pressure systems</li>
</ul>
During inhalation negative pressure respirators have lower air pressure inside the facepiece compared to the air pressure outside. If the facepiece-to-face seal leaks on these types of respirators, air contaminants will be drawn into the breathing air. All respirators without a supplied-air component are considered negative pressure respirators.
Positive pressure respirators maintain positive air pressure inside the facepiece at all times by means of supplied air. Therefore the air pressure inside the facepiece remains greater than the air pressure outside the facepiece. Thus, any leakage around the facepiece seal should result in air escaping from inside the facepiece to the outside environment rather than worksite contaminants leaking into the facepiece.[/expand]

[expand title="Positive Pressure Modes"]There are three modes that positive pressure respirators operate in:
<ul>
 	<li>Demand mode</li>
 	<li>Pressure demand mode</li>
 	<li>Continuous flow mode</li>
</ul>
Demand mode means that air only flows into the mask when you inhale. This system would allow outside air in if there was a breach around the seal of the respirator, because the pressure is lower inside the mask during inhalation. This affects the protection factors of the respirator. Pressure demand mode means that throughout the breathing cycle the supplied air regulator works to maintain positive pressure inside of the respirator. If there is a breach in the seal of the respirator, the air inside of the respirator will escape from where the breach is not allowing outside air to enter.
Continuous flow mode means that a continuous stream of air is blown into the facepiece at all times.
If the respirator also has filters or cartridges is important to choose filters that have the appropriate APF for the mode in which the respirator will be operating.[/expand]]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[[expand title="Caring for your respirator"]
Respirator care is a vital part of any respiratory protection program. Regularly caring for your respirator ensures that it is always in good working condition and capable of offering the protection you need for your job.[/expand]

[expand title="Employer"]
Employers are required to establish procedures and regular maintenance schedules for the care of all respirators used by their employees (unless they are voluntary respirators). This includes procedures for the cleaning, storing, inspecting, and repairing or disposing of respirators.
Care must always be done in accordance with OSHA requirements, but manufacturers’ directions should also be considered, as there may be cleaning solutions that should not be used on certain types of respirators.[/expand]

[expand title="Regular care"]
Respirators should always be inspected for damage before and after use. Pay particular attention to:
Basic functionality (user fit test)
Connections (check tightness)
Facepiece
Head straps
Valves
Tubes
Hoses
Any cartridges, canisters, or filters
Elastomeric parts (check for pliability, signs of deterioration)[/expand]

[expand title="Damage"]
Remove any damaged respirators form use to either be discarded or repaired by a trained person. If your respirator fails an inspection or is defective, your employer must remove it from service and either repair it or discard it. Repairs must be made according to the respirator manufacturer's instructions and must use only NIOSH-approved parts that are designed for the respirator.[/expand]

[expand title="Storage"]
It is important for respirators to be stored properly to protect them from damage or contamination. Sunlight, extreme temperatures, excessive moisture, and some chemicals can all damage respirators. Always store your respirator in a way that prevents deforming the facepiece or exhalation valve. Never leave your respirator hanging on a machine, lying on your workbench, tucked into your pocket, or tossed into your toolbox or a drawer.[/expand]

[expand title="Changing filters"]
Always change filters on schedule. If you use a respirator for protection against gases and vapors, your employer must determine a schedule for replacing worn out cartridges or canisters. This is known as a "change-out schedule." Your employer is responsible for providing this information to you, so that you know when a cartridge or canister must be changed.[/expand]]]></content:encoded>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[[expand title="Overview"]Respirators only provide protection from respiratory hazards when they are properly selected and used in compliance with the Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134 and 29 CFR 1926.103). It is imperative to choose the right respirator for the job and to maintain the respirator so that it continues to provide optimum protection from the hazards of the worksite.[/expand]

[expand title="Eye Irritation"]Eye protecting full facepieces, helmets, or hoods are required for routine exposures to airborne contaminants that cause any eye irritation. When data on threshold levels for eye irritation are insufficient, quarter or half-mask respirators can be used, as long as the worker has no eye discomfort. For escape, some eye irritation is permissible if the severity of irritation does not inhibit the escape and if no irreversible damage is likely.[/expand]

[expand title="When to leave"]<strong>If you detect any odor while wearing your respirator, get out immediately.</strong>

Employers are required to provide a “safe area” in the workplace where workers can safely remove their respirators to wash or conduct maintenance on them. You should never adjust a respirator in the contaminated work area. Always go to the safe area before removing your respirator.

Other reasons you may need to leave the work area include:
<ul>
 	<li>If you need to wash your face or the respirator facepiece to prevent eye or skin irritation associated with respirator use.</li>
 	<li>If you detect vapor or gas breaking through (the filter may need changed).</li>
 	<li>If you notice that the facepiece is leaking.</li>
 	<li>If you observe a change in breathing resistance (the filter may need changed).</li>
 	<li>If the respirator or parts of the respirator, such as valves or straps, are not working properly and need to be replaced.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title="Kinds of Hazards Encountered"]Airborne vapors, gases, dust, fogs, fumes, fibers, mists, smokes, or sprays all can carry or contain hazardous substances and present serious dangers to workers who inhale them. There are also hazardous atmospheres such as low-oxygen atmospheres that can endanger the life of the employee. Respirators protect against many of these dangers.[/expand]

[expand title="User Seal Check"]User seal checks are a quick and easy way for employees to verify that they have put on their respirators correctly and that the respirators are working properly. A user seal check is NOT a kind of fit testing.

To conduct a user seal check, the employee performs a negative or positive pressure fit check, depending on what kind of respirator they’re using.

For the negative pressure check, the employee:
<ul>
 	<li>covers the respirator inlets (cartridges, canisters, or seals)</li>
 	<li>gently inhales, and</li>
 	<li>holds breath for 10 seconds.The facepiece should collapse on the worker’s face and remain collapsed.</li>
</ul>
For the positive pressure check, the worker:
<ul>
 	<li>covers the respirator exhalation valve(s), and</li>
 	<li>exhales.</li>
</ul>
The facepiece should hold the positive pressure for a few seconds. During this time, the employee should not hear or feel the air leaking out of the face-to-facepiece seal.[/expand]]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[[expand title="Overview"]There are two kinds of fit-testing:
<ul>
 	<li>Qualitative</li>
 	<li>Quantitative</li>
</ul>
Fit testing is used to determine how well a respirator “fits”—that is, whether the respirator forms a seal on the user’s face. If there’s not a good facepiece-to-face seal, the respirator will provide a lower level of protection than it was rated for. The <u>APFs</u> only apply if the respirators are properly selected and used in compliance with the full respirator program, including initial fit testing. Fit testing must be performed before initial use and then at least once a year. <u>The Respiratory Protection standard</u> requires employers to conduct fit testing on all employees who are required to wear a respirator that includes a <u>tight-fitting</u> facepiece.[/expand]

[expand title="Quantitative fit test (QNFT)"]Quantitative fit testing is a method of measuring the amount of leakage into a respirator. It is a numeric assessment of how well a respirator fits a particular individual. To quantitatively fit test a respirator, sampling probes or other measuring devices must be placed to measure aerosol concentrations both outside and on the inside of the respirator facepiece. The respirator wearer then performs the usual <u>user seal checks.</u>[/expand]

[expand title="Qualitative fit test (QLFT)"]Qualitative fit testing is a pass/fail test that relies on the respirator wearer’s response to a substance (“test agent”) used in the test to determine respirator fit.In qualitative fit testing, after performing user seal checks, the respirator wearer stands in an enclosure and a test agent is introduced.If the individual can detect the test agent, this indicates that the agent leaked into the facepiece and that the respirator has failed the test because a good facepiece-to- face seal has not been achieved.[/expand]

[expand title="When to fit-test"]Fit testing must be conducted for all employees required to wear <u>tight-fitting</u> facepiece respirators as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>Prior to initial use.</li>
 	<li>Whenever an employee switches to a different tightfitting facepiece respirator (for example, a different size, make or model).</li>
 	<li>At least annually.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title="Fit Testing Atmosphere- Supplying Respirators"]All fit testing conducted for <u>tight-fitting atmosphere-supplying respirators</u> and <u>powered air-purifying respirators</u> must be conducted in the <u>negative pressure</u> mode, even if the respirator will be used with <u>positive</u> pressure. This is because it is difficult outside of a laboratory test situation to accurately perform fit testing on positive pressure respirators.[/expand]]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1910.134(a)(1) Controlling Hazards</strong>
In the control of those occupational diseases caused by breathing air contaminated with harmful dusts, fogs, fumes, mists, gases, smokes, sprays, or vapors, the primary objective shall be to prevent atmospheric contamination. This shall be accomplished as far as feasible by accepted engineering control measures (for example, enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation, and substitution of less toxic materials). When effective engineering controls are not feasible, or while they are being instituted, appropriate respirators shall be used pursuant to this section.

<strong>1910.134(a)(2) Employer Responsibilities</strong>
A respirator shall be provided to each employee when such equipment is necessary to protect the health of such employee. The employer shall provide the respirators which are applicable and suitable for the purpose intended. The employer shall be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of a respiratory protection program, which shall include the requirements outlined in paragraph (c) of this section. The program shall cover each employee required by this section to use a respirator.]]></content:encoded>

[expand title="Maximum use concentration (MUC)"]
The maximum atmospheric concentration of a hazardous substance from which an employee can be expected to be protected when wearing a respirator, and is determined by the assigned protection factor of the respirator or class of respirators and the exposure limit of the hazardous substance. The MUC can be determined mathematically by multiplying the assigned protection factor specified for a respirator by the required OSHA permissible exposure limit, short-term exposure limit, or ceiling limit. When no OSHA exposure limit is available for a hazardous substance, an employer must determine an MUC on the basis of relevant available information and informed professional judgment.[/expand]

[expand title="Negative pressure respirator (tight-fitting)"]
A respirator in which the air pressure inside the facepiece is negative during inhalation with respect to the ambient air pressure outside the respirator.[/expand]

[expand title="Oxygen deficient atmosphere"]
An atmosphere with an oxygen content below 19.5% by volume.[/expand]

[expand title="Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL)"]
An occupational exposure limit specified by OSHA.[/expand]

[expand title="Physician or other licensed healthcare professional (PLHCP)"]

[expand title="Pressure demand respirator"]
A positive pressure atmosphere-supplying respirator that admits breathing air to the facepiece when the positive pressure is reduced inside the facepiece by inhalation.[/expand]

[expand title="Protection factor study"]
A study that determines the protection provided by a respirator during use. This determination generally is accomplished by measuring the ratio of the concentration of an airborne contaminant (e.g., hazardous substance) outside the respirator (Co) to the concentration inside the respirator (Ci) (i.e., Co/Ci). Therefore, as the ratio between Co and Ci increases, the protection factor increases, indicating an increase in the level of protection provided to employees by the respirator. There are four types of protection factor studies: EPF, PPF, WPF, and SWPF.[/expand]

[expand title="Effective Protection Factor (EPF) study"]
A study, conducted in the workplace, that measures the protection provided by a properly selected, fit-tested, and functioning respirator when used intermittently for only some fraction of the total workplace exposure time (i.e., sampling is conducted during periods when respirators are worn and not worn). EPFs are not directly comparable to Workplace Protection Factor (WPF) values because the determinations include both the time spent in contaminated atmospheres with and without respiratory protection; therefore, EPFs usually underestimate the protection afforded by a respirator that is used continuously in the workplace.[/expand]

[expand title="Program Protection Factor (PPF) study"]
A study that estimates the protection provided by a respirator within a specific respirator program. Like the EPF, it is focused not only on the respirator’s performance, but also the effectiveness of the complete respirator program. PPFs are affected by all factors of the program, including respirator selection and maintenance, user training and motivation, work activities and program administration.[/expand]

[expand title="Workplace Protection Factor (WPF) study"]
A study, conducted under actual conditions of use in the workplace, that measures the protection provided by a properly selected, fit-tested, and functioning respirator, when the respirator is worn correctly and used as part of a comprehensive respirator program that is in compliance with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard at <a href="https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=12716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29 CFR 1910.134</a>. Measurements of Co (Concentration outside) and Ci (Concentration inside) are obtained only while the respirator is being worn during performance of normal work tasks (i.e., samples are not collected when the respirator is not being worn). As the degree of protection afforded by the respirator increases, the WPF increases.[/expand]

[expand title="Simulated Workplace Protection Factor (SWPF) study"]
A study, conducted in a controlled laboratory setting and in which Co and Ci sampling is performed while the respirator user performs a series of set exercises. The laboratory setting is used to control many of the variables found in workplace studies, while the exercises simulate the work activities of respirator users. This type of study is designed to determine the optimum performance of respirators by reducing the impact of sources of variability through maintenance of tightly controlled study conditions.[/expand]

[expand title="Qualitative fit test (QLFT)"]
A pass/fail fit test to assess the adequacy of respirator fit that relies on the individual’s response to the test agent.[/expand]

[expand title="Quantitative fit test (QNFT)"]
An assessment of the adequacy of respirator fit by numerically measuring the amount of leakage into the respirator.[/expand]

[expand title="Recommended Exposure Limit (REL)"]
An occupational exposure level recommended by NIOSH.[/expand]

[expand title="Respirator Decision Logic (RDL)"]
Respirator selection guidance developed by NIOSH that contains a set of respirator protection factors.[/expand]

[expand title="Respiratory inlet covering"]
That portion of a respirator that forms the protective barrier between the user’s respiratory tract and an air-purifying device or breathing air source, or both. It may be a facepiece, helmet, hood, suit, or a mouthpiece respirator with nose clamp.[/expand]

[expand title="Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)"]
An atmosphere- supplying respirator for which the breathing air source is designed to be carried by the user.[/expand]

[expand title="Supplied-air respirator (or airline) respirator (SAR)"]
An atmosphere-supplying respirator for which the source of breathing air is not designed to be carried by the user.[/expand]

[expand title="Threshold Limit Value (TLV)"]
An occupational exposure level recommended by the ACGIH (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists).[/expand]

[expand title="Tight-fitting facepiece"]
A respiratory inlet covering that forms a complete seal with the face.[/expand]

[expand title="Time-weighted average (TWA)"]
Time-Weighted Average is used to measure a worker's daily exposure to hazardous substances, averaged on an 8-hour workday. The average is calculated from air samples throughout a work cycle and the amount of time spent working in those conditions. OSHA uses TWAs to establish <em>Permissible Exposure Limits</em> for the contaminants encountered in industries.
The TWA is calculated in units of parts per million (ppm) or mg/m3.[/expand]

[expand title="User seal check"]
An action conducted by the respirator user to determine if the respirator is properly seated to the face.[/expand]]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This paragraph requires the employer to develop and implement a written respiratory protection program with required worksite-specific procedures and elements for required respirator use. The program must be administered by a suitably trained program administrator. In addition, certain program elements may be required for voluntary use to prevent potential hazards associated with the use of the respirator. The Small Entity Compliance Guide contains criteria for the selection of a program administrator and a sample program that meets the requirements of this paragraph. Copies of the Small Entity Compliance Guide will be available on or about April 8, 1998 from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Office of Publications, Room N 3101, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC, 20210 (202-219-4667).

[expand title="1910.134(c)(1) Program Provisions"]
In any workplace where respirators are necessary to protect the health of the employee or whenever respirators are required by the employer, the employer shall establish and implement a written respiratory protection program with worksite-specific procedures. The program shall be updated as necessary to reflect those changes in workplace conditions that affect respirator use. The employer shall include in the program the following provisions of this section, as applicable:
<strong>1910.134(c)(1)(i)</strong>

Procedures for selecting respirators for use in the workplace;

<strong>1910.134(c)(1)(ii)</strong>

Medical evaluations of employees required to use respirators;

<strong>1910.134(c)(1)(iii)</strong>

Fit testing procedures for tight-fitting respirators;

<strong>1910.134(c)(1)(iv)</strong>

Procedures for proper use of respirators in routine and reasonably foreseeable emergency situations;

<strong>1910.134(c)(1)(v)</strong>

Procedures and schedules for cleaning, disinfecting, storing, inspecting, repairing, discarding, and otherwise maintaining respirators;

<strong>1910.134(c)(1)(vi)</strong>

Procedures to ensure adequate air quality, quantity, and flow of breathing air for atmosphere-supplying respirators;

<strong>1910.134(c)(1)(vii)</strong>

Training of employees in the respiratory hazards to which they are potentially exposed during routine and emergency situations;

<strong>1910.134(c)(1)(viii)</strong>
Training of employees in the proper use of respirators, including putting on and removing them, any limitations on their use, and their maintenance; and

<strong>1910.134(c)(1)(ix)</strong>

Procedures for regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the program.
[/expand]

[expand title="1910.134(c)(2) Non-Required Respirator Use"]

Where respirator use is not required:

<strong>1910.134(c)(2)(i)</strong>

An employer may provide respirators at the request of employees or permit employees to use their own respirators, if the employer determines that such respirator use will not in itself create a hazard. If the employer determines that any voluntary respirator use is permissible, the employer shall provide the respirator users with the information contained in Appendix D to this section ("Information for Employees Using Respirators When Not Required Under the Standard"); and

<strong>1910.134(c)(2)(ii)</strong>

In addition, the employer must establish and implement those elements of a written respiratory protection program necessary to ensure that any employee using a respirator voluntarily is medically able to use that respirator, and that the respirator is cleaned, stored, and maintained so that its use does not present a health hazard to the user. Exception: Employers are not required to include in a written respiratory protection program those employees whose only use of respirators involves the voluntary use of filtering facepieces (dust masks).[/expand]

[expand title="1910.134(c)(3) Program Administrator"]
The employer shall designate a program administrator who is qualified by appropriate training or experience that is commensurate with the complexity of the program to administer or oversee the respiratory protection program and conduct the required evaluations of program effectiveness.[/expand]

[expand title="1910.134(c)(4) Employer Provisions"]
The employer shall provide respirators, training, and medical evaluations at no cost to the employee.[/expand]]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This paragraph requires the employer to evaluate respiratory hazard(s) in the workplace, identify relevant workplace and user factors, and base respirator selection on these factors. The paragraph also specifies appropriately protective respirators for use in IDLH atmospheres, and limits the selection and use of air-purifying respirators.
[expand title="1910.134(d)(1) General Requirements"]

<strong>1910.134(d)(1)(i)</strong>

The employer shall select and provide an appropriate respirator based on the respiratory hazard(s) to which the worker is exposed and workplace and user factors that affect respirator performance and reliability.

<strong>1910.134(d)(1)(ii)</strong>

The employer shall select a NIOSH-certified respirator. The respirator shall be used in compliance with the conditions of its certification.

<strong>1910.134(d)(1)(iii)</strong>

The employer shall identify and evaluate the respiratory hazard(s) in the workplace; this evaluation shall include a reasonable estimate of employee exposures to respiratory hazard(s) and an identification of the contaminant's chemical state and physical form. Where the employer cannot identify or reasonably estimate the employee exposure, the employer shall consider the atmosphere to be IDLH.

<strong>1910.134(d)(1)(iv)</strong>

The employer shall select respirators from a sufficient number of respirator models and sizes so that the respirator is acceptable to, and correctly fits, the user.[/expand]
[expand title="1910.134(d)(2) Respirators for IDLH Atmospheres"]

<strong>1910.134(d)(2)(i)</strong>

The employer shall provide the following respirators for employee use in IDLH atmospheres:

<strong>1910.134(d)(2)(i)(A)</strong>

A full facepiece pressure demand SCBA certified by NIOSH for a minimum service life of thirty minutes, or

<strong>1910.134(d)(2)(i)(B)</strong>

A combination full facepiece pressure demand supplied-air respirator (SAR) with auxiliary self-contained air supply.

<strong>1910.134(d)(2)(ii)</strong>

Respirators provided only for escape from IDLH atmospheres shall be NIOSH-certified for escape from the atmosphere in which they will be used.

<strong>1910.134(d)(2)(iii)</strong>

All oxygen-deficient atmospheres shall be considered IDLH. Exception: If the employer demonstrates that, under all foreseeable conditions, the oxygen concentration can be maintained within the ranges specified in Table II of this section (i.e., for the altitudes set out in the table), then any atmosphere-supplying respirator may be used.[/expand]

[expand title="1910.134(d)(3) Respirators for non-IDLH Atmospheres"]

<strong>1910.134(d)(3)(i)</strong>

The employer shall provide a respirator that is adequate to protect the health of the employee and ensure compliance with all other OSHA statutory and regulatory requirements, under routine and reasonably foreseeable emergency situations.
[/expand]
[expand title="1910.134(d)(3)(i)(A) Assigned Protection Factors (APFs)"]
Assigned Protection Factors (APFs) Employers must use the assigned protection factors listed in Table 1 to select a respirator that meets or exceeds the required level of employee protection. When using a combination respirator (e.g., airline respirators with an air-purifying filter), employers must ensure that the assigned protection factor is appropriate to the mode of operation in which the respirator is being used.

[table id=34 /]

<strong>Notes:</strong>

<strong>Note 1:</strong> Employers may select respirators assigned for use in higher workplace concentrations of a hazardous substance for use at lower concentrations of that substance, or when required respirator use is independent of concentration.

<strong>Note 2:</strong> The assigned protection factors in Table 1 are only effective when the employer implements a continuing, effective respirator program as required by this section (29 CFR 1910.134), including training, fit testing, maintenance, and use requirements.

<strong>Note 3:</strong> This APF category includes filtering facepieces, and half masks with elastomeric facepieces.

<strong>Note 4:</strong> The employer must have evidence provided by the respirator manufacturer that testing of these respirators demonstrates performance at a level of protection of 1,000 or greater to receive an APF of 1,000. This level of performance can best be demonstrated by performing a WPF or SWPF study or equivalent testing. Absent such testing, all other PAPRs and SARs with helmets/hoods are to be treated as loose-fitting facepiece respirators, and receive an APF of 25.

<strong>Note 5:</strong> These APFs do not apply to respirators used solely for escape. For escape respirators used in association with specific substances covered by 29 CFR 1910 subpart Z, employers must refer to the appropriate substance-specific standards in that subpart. Escape respirators for other IDLH atmospheres are specified by 29 CFR 1910.134 (d)(2)(ii).

[/expand]
[expand title="1910.134(d)(3)(i)(B) Maximum Use Concentration (MUC)"]

<strong>1910.134(d)(3)(i)(B)(1)</strong>

The employer must select a respirator for employee use that maintains the employee's exposure to the hazardous substance, when measured outside the respirator, at or below the MUC.

<strong>1910.134(d)(3)(i)(B)(2)</strong>

Employers must not apply MUCs to conditions that are immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH); instead, they must use respirators listed for IDLH conditions in paragraph (d)(2) of this standard.

<strong>1910.134(d)(3)(i)(B)(3)</strong>

When the calculated MUC exceeds the IDLH level for a hazardous substance, or the performance limits of the cartridge or canister, then employers must set the maximum MUC at that lower limit.

[/expand]
[expand title="1910.134(d)(3) (CONTINUED&gt; Respirators for non-IDLH Atmospheres)
<strong>1910.134(d)(3)(ii)</strong>

The respirator selected shall be appropriate for the chemical state and physical form of the contaminant.

<strong>1910.134(d)(3)(iii)</strong>

For protection against gases and vapors, the employer shall provide:

<strong>1910.134(d)(3)(iii)(A)</strong>

An atmosphere-supplying respirator, or

<strong>1910.134(d)(3)(iii)(B)</strong>

An air-purifying respirator, provided that:

<strong>1910.134(d)(3)(iii)(B)(1)</strong>

The respirator is equipped with an end-of-service-life indicator (ESLI) certified by NIOSH for the contaminant; or

<strong>1910.134(d)(3)(iii)(B)(2)</strong>

If there is no ESLI appropriate for conditions in the employer's workplace, the employer implements a change schedule for canisters and cartridges that is based on objective information or data that will ensure that canisters and cartridges are changed before the end of their service life. The employer shall describe in the respirator program the information and data relied upon and the basis for the canister and cartridge change schedule and the basis for reliance on the data.

<strong>1910.134(d)(3)(iv)</strong>

For protection against particulates, the employer shall provide:

<strong>1910.134(d)(3)(iv)(A)</strong>

An atmosphere-supplying respirator; or

<strong>1910.134(d)(3)(iv)(B)</strong>

An air-purifying respirator equipped with a filter certified by NIOSH under 30 CFR part 11 as a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, or an air-purifying respirator equipped with a filter certified for particulates by NIOSH under 42 CFR part 84; or

<strong>1910.134(d)(3)(iv)(C)</strong>

For contaminants consisting primarily of particles with mass median aerodynamic diameters (MMAD) of at least 2 micrometers, an air-purifying respirator equipped with any filter certified for particulates by NIOSH.

TABLE II. -- ASSIGNED PROTECTION FACTORS, (RESERVED)

[table id=33 /]

<strong>Note 1:</strong> Above 8,000 feet the exception does not apply. Oxygen-
enriched breathing air must be supplied above 14,000 feet.[/expand]]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Using a respirator may place a physiological burden on employees that varies with the type of respirator worn, the job and workplace conditions in which the respirator is used, and the medical status of the employee. Accordingly, this paragraph specifies the minimum requirements for medical evaluation that employers must implement to determine the employee's ability to use a respirator.

[expand title="1910.134(e)(1) General"]
The employer shall provide a medical evaluation to determine the employee's ability to use a respirator, before the employee is fit tested or required to use the respirator in the workplace. The employer may discontinue an employee's medical evaluations when the employee is no longer required to use a respirator.[/expand]

[expand title="1910.134(e)(2) Medical Evaluation Procedures"]
<strong>1910.134(e)(2)(i)</strong>

The employer shall identify a physician or other licensed health care professional (PLHCP) to perform medical evaluations using a medical questionnaire or an initial medical examination that obtains the same information as the medical questionnaire.

<strong>1910.134(e)(2)(ii)</strong>

The medical evaluation shall obtain the information requested by the questionnaire in Sections 1 and 2, Part A of Appendix C of this section.[/expand]

[expand title="1910.134(e)(3) Follow-up Medical Examination"]
<strong>1910.134(e)(3)(i)</strong>

The employer shall ensure that a follow-up medical examination is provided for an employee who gives a positive response to any question among questions 1 through 8 in Section 2, Part A of Appendix C or whose initial medical examination demonstrates the need for a follow-up medical examination.

<strong>1910.134(e)(3)(ii)</strong>

The follow-up medical examination shall include any medical tests, consultations, or diagnostic procedures that the PLHCP deems necessary to make a final determination.[/expand]

[expand title="1910.134(e)(4) Admin. of Medical Questionnaire and Examinations"]
<strong>1910.134(e)(4)(i)</strong>

The medical questionnaire and examinations shall be administered confidentially during the employee's normal working hours or at a time and place convenient to the employee. The medical questionnaire shall be administered in a manner that ensures that the employee understands its content.

<strong>1910.134(e)(4)(ii)</strong>

The employer shall provide the employee with an opportunity to discuss the questionnaire and examination results with the PLHCP.[/expand]

[expand title="1910.134(e)(5) Supplemental Information for the PLHCP"]
<strong>1910.134(e)(5)(i)</strong>

The following information must be provided to the PLHCP before the PLHCP makes a recommendation concerning an employee's ability to use a respirator:

<strong>1910.134(e)(5)(i)(A)</strong>

(A) The type and weight of the respirator to be used by the employee;

<strong>1910.134(e)(5)(i)(B)</strong>

The duration and frequency of respirator use (including use for rescue and escape);

<strong>1910.134(e)(5)(i)(C)</strong>

The expected physical work effort;

<strong>1910.134(e)(5)(i)(D)</strong>

Additional protective clothing and equipment to be worn; and

<strong>1910.134(e)(5)(i)(E)</strong>

Temperature and humidity extremes that may be encountered.

<strong>1910.134(e)(5)(ii)</strong>

Any supplemental information provided previously to the PLHCP regarding an employee need not be provided for a subsequent medical evaluation if the information and the PLHCP remain the same.

<strong>1910.134(e)(5)(iii)</strong>

The employer shall provide the PLHCP with a copy of the written respiratory protection program and a copy of this section.

Note to Paragraph (e)(5)(iii): When the employer replaces a PLHCP, the employer must ensure that the new PLHCP obtains this information, either by providing the documents directly to the PLHCP or having the documents transferred from the former PLHCP to the new PLHCP. However, OSHA does not expect employers to have employees medically reevaluated solely because a new PLHCP has been selected.[/expand]

[expand title="1910.134(e)(6) Medical Determination"]
In determining the employee's ability to use a respirator, the employer shall:

<strong>1910.134(e)(6)(i)</strong>

Obtain a written recommendation regarding the employee's ability to use the respirator from the PLHCP. The recommendation shall provide only the following information:

<strong>1910.134(e)(6)(i)(A)</strong>

Any limitations on respirator use related to the medical condition of the employee, or relating to the workplace conditions in which the respirator will be used, including whether or not the employee is medically able to use the respirator;

<strong>1910.134(e)(6)(i)(B)</strong>

The need, if any, for follow-up medical evaluations; and

<strong>1910.134(e)(6)(i)(C)</strong>

A statement that the PLHCP has provided the employee with a copy of the PLHCP's written recommendation.

<strong>1910.134(e)(6)(ii)</strong>

If the respirator is a negative pressure respirator and the PLHCP finds a medical condition that may place the employee's health at increased risk if the respirator is used, the employer shall provide a PAPR if the PLHCP's medical evaluation finds that the employee can use such a respirator; if a subsequent medical evaluation finds that the employee is medically able to use a negative pressure respirator, then the employer is no longer required to provide a PAPR.[/expand]

[expand title="1910.134(e)(7) Additional Medical Evaluations"]
At a minimum, the employer shall provide additional medical evaluations that comply with the requirements of this section if:

<strong>1910.134(e)(7)(i)</strong>

An employee reports medical signs or symptoms that are related to ability to use a respirator;

<strong>1910.134(e)(7)(ii)</strong>

A PLHCP, supervisor, or the respirator program administrator informs the employer that an employee needs to be reevaluated;

<strong>1910.134(e)(7)(iii)</strong>

Information from the respiratory protection program, including observations made during fit testing and program evaluation, indicates a need for employee reevaluation; or

<strong>1910.134(e)(7)(iv)</strong>

A change occurs in workplace conditions (e.g., physical work effort, protective clothing, temperature) that may result in a substantial increase in the physiological burden placed on an employee.[/expand]]]></content:encoded>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This paragraph requires that, before an employee may be required to use any respirator with a negative or positive pressure tight-fitting facepiece, the employee must be fit tested with the same make, model, style, and size of respirator that will be used. This paragraph specifies the kinds of fit tests allowed, the procedures for conducting them, and how the results of the fit tests must be used.

[expand title="1910.134(f)(1) Fit Test Passed"]
The employer shall ensure that employees using a tight-fitting facepiece respirator pass an appropriate qualitative fit test (QLFT) or quantitative fit test (QNFT) as stated in this paragraph.[/expand]

[expand title="1910.134(f)(2) When to Fit Test"]
The employer shall ensure that an employee using a tight-fitting facepiece respirator is fit tested prior to initial use of the respirator, whenever a different respirator facepiece (size, style, model or make) is used, and at least annually thereafter.[/expand]

[expand title="1910.134(f)(3) Additional Fit Tests"]
The employer shall conduct an additional fit test whenever the employee reports, or the employer, PLHCP, supervisor, or program administrator makes visual observations of, changes in the employee's physical condition that could affect respirator fit. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, facial scarring, dental changes, cosmetic surgery, or an obvious change in body weight.[/expand]

[expand title="1910.134(f)(4) Selecting a Different Respirator"]
If after passing a QLFT or QNFT, the employee subsequently notifies the employer, program administrator, supervisor, or PLHCP that the fit of the respirator is unacceptable, the employee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to select a different respirator facepiece and to be retested.[/expand]

[expand title="1910.134(f)(5) Fit Test Protocols"]
The fit test shall be administered using an OSHA-accepted QLFT or QNFT protocol. The OSHA-accepted QLFT and QNFT protocols and procedures are contained in Appendix A of this section.[/expand]
[expand title="1910.134(f)(6) QLFT"]
QLFT may only be used to fit test negative pressure air-purifying respirators that must achieve a fit factor of 100 or less.[/expand]
[expand title="1910.134(f)(7) QNFT"]
If the fit factor, as determined through an OSHA-accepted QNFT protocol, is equal to or greater than 100 for tight-fitting half facepieces, or equal to or greater than 500 for tight-fitting full facepieces, the QNFT has been passed with that respirator.[/expand]
[expand title="1910.134(f)(8) Negative Pressure Mode"]
Fit testing of tight-fitting atmosphere-supplying respirators and tight-fitting powered air-purifying respirators shall be accomplished by performing quantitative or qualitative fit testing in the negative pressure mode, regardless of the mode of operation (negative or positive pressure) that is used for respiratory protection.

<strong>1910.134(f)(8)(i)</strong>

Qualitative fit testing of these respirators shall be accomplished by temporarily converting the respirator user's actual facepiece into a negative pressure respirator with appropriate filters, or by using an identical negative pressure air-purifying respirator facepiece with the same sealing surfaces as a surrogate for the atmosphere-supplying or powered air-purifying respirator facepiece.

<strong>1910.134(f)(8)(ii)</strong>

Quantitative fit testing of these respirators shall be accomplished by modifying the facepiece to allow sampling inside the facepiece in the breathing zone of the user, midway between the nose and mouth. This requirement shall be accomplished by installing a permanent sampling probe onto a surrogate facepiece, or by using a sampling adapter designed to temporarily provide a means of sampling air from inside the facepiece.

<strong>1910.134(f)(8)(iii)</strong>

Any modifications to the respirator facepiece for fit testing shall be completely removed, and the facepiece restored to NIOSH-approved configuration, before that facepiece can be used in the workplace.[/expand]]]></content:encoded>

  <description></description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This paragraph requires employers to establish and implement procedures for the proper use of respirators. These requirements include prohibiting conditions that may result in facepiece seal leakage, preventing employees from removing respirators in hazardous environments, taking actions to ensure continued effective respirator operation throughout the work shift, and establishing procedures for the use of respirators in IDLH atmospheres or in interior structural firefighting situations.

[expand title="1910.134(g)(1) Facepiece Seal Protection"]
<strong>1910.134(g)(1)(i)</strong>

The employer shall not permit respirators with tight-fitting facepieces to be worn by employees who have:

<strong>1910.134(g)(1)(i)(A)</strong>

Facial hair that comes between the sealing surface of the facepiece and the face or that interferes with valve function; or

<strong>1910.134(g)(1)(i)(B)</strong>

Any condition that interferes with the face-to-facepiece seal or valve function.

<strong>1910.134(g)(1)(ii)</strong>

If an employee wears corrective glasses or goggles or other personal protective equipment, the employer shall ensure that such equipment is worn in a manner that does not interfere with the seal of the facepiece to the face of the user.

<strong>1910.134(g)(1)(iii)</strong>

For all tight-fitting respirators, the employer shall ensure that employees perform a user seal check each time they put on the respirator using the procedures in Appendix B-1 or procedures recommended by the respirator manufacturer that the employer demonstrates are as effective as those in Appendix B-1 of this section.[/expand]

[expand title="1910.134(g)(2) Continuing Respirator Effectiveness"]

<strong>1910.134(g)(2)(i)</strong>

Appropriate surveillance shall be maintained of work area conditions and degree of employee exposure or stress. When there is a change in work area conditions or degree of employee exposure or stress that may affect respirator effectiveness, the employer shall reevaluate the continued effectiveness of the respirator.

<strong>1910.134(g)(2)(ii)</strong>

The employer shall ensure that employees leave the respirator use area:

<strong>1910.134(g)(2)(ii)(A)</strong>

To wash their faces and respirator facepieces as necessary to prevent eye or skin irritation associated with respirator use; or

<strong>1910.134(g)(2)(ii)(B)</strong>

If they detect vapor or gas breakthrough, changes in breathing resistance, or leakage of the facepiece; or

<strong>1910.134(g)(2)(ii)(C)</strong>

To replace the respirator or the filter, cartridge, or canister elements.

<strong>1910.134(g)(2)(iii)</strong>

If the employee detects vapor or gas breakthrough, changes in breathing resistance, or leakage of the facepiece, the employer must replace or repair the respirator before allowing the employee to return to the work area.[/expand]

[expand title="1910.134(g)(3) Procedures for IDLH Atmospheres"]
For all IDLH atmospheres, the employer shall ensure that:

<strong>1910.134(g)(3)(i)</strong>

One employee or, when needed, more than one employee is located outside the IDLH atmosphere;

<strong>1910.134(g)(3)(ii)</strong>

Visual, voice, or signal line communication is maintained between the employee(s) in the IDLH atmosphere and the employee(s) located outside the IDLH atmosphere;

<strong>1910.134(g)(3)(iii)</strong>

The employee(s) located outside the IDLH atmosphere are trained and equipped to provide effective emergency rescue;

<strong>1910.134(g)(3)(iv)</strong>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The following acronyms may be encountered in respirator selection. yeahhh

[expand title="ACGIH"]
American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists[/expand]
[expand title="AIHA"]
American Industrial Hygiene Association[/expand]
[expand title="ANSI"]
American National Standards Institute[/expand]
[expand title="APF"]
The Assigned Protection Factor (APF) indicates the workplace level of respiratory protection that a respirator or class of respirators is expected to provide to employees when the employer implements a continuing, effective respiratory protection program as specified by this section.[/expand]
[expand title="APR"]
An air-purifying respirator (APR) is a respirator with an air-purifying filter, cartridge, or canister that removes specific air contaminants by passing ambient air through the air-purifying element.[/expand]
[expand title="Ci"]
Concentration Inside. The concentration measured inside the respirator facepiece[/expand]
[expand title="Co"]
Concentration Outside. Concentration measured outside the respirator.[/expand]
[expand title="DFM"]
A Dust, Fume, and Mist filter[/expand]
[expand title="DOP"]
Dioctylphthalate, which is an aerosolized agent used for quantitative fit testing.[/expand]
[expand title="EPF"]
A Effective Protection Factor (EPF) study is a study, conducted in the workplace, that measures the protection provided by a properly selected, fit-tested, and functioning respirator when used intermittently for only some fraction of the total workplace exposure time (i.e., sampling is conducted during periods when respirators are worn and not worn). EPFs are not directly comparable to Workplace Protection Factor (WPF) values because the determinations include both the time spent in contaminated atmospheres with and without respiratory protection; therefore, EPFs usually underestimate the protection afforded by a respirator that is used continuously in the workplace.[/expand]
[expand title="HEPA"]
A High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter is a filter that is at least 99.97% efficient in removing monodispersed particles of 0.3 micrometers in diameter. The equivalent <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/pt84abs2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIOSH 42 CFR 84</a> particulate filters are the N100, R100, and P100 filters.[/expand]
[expand title="IDLH"]
Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health. An atmosphere that poses an immediate threat to life, would cause irreversible adverse health effects, or would impair an individual’s ability to escape from a dangerous atmosphere.[/expand]
[expand title="LANL"]
Los Alamos National Laboratory[/expand]
[expand title="LASL"]
Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory[/expand]
[expand title="LLNL"]
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory[/expand]
[expand title="MSHA"]
Mine Safety and Health Administration[/expand]
[expand title="MUC"]
Maximum Use Concentration (MUC) is the maximum atmospheric concentration of a hazardous substance from which an employee can be expected to be protected when wearing a respirator, and is determined by the assigned protection factor of the respirator or class of respirators and the exposure limit of the hazardous substance. The MUC can be determined mathematically by multiplying the assigned protection factor specified for a respirator by the required OSHA permissible exposure limit, short-term exposure limit, or ceiling limit. When no OSHA exposure limit is available for a hazardous substance, an employer must determine an MUC on the basis of relevant available information and informed professional judgment.[/expand]
[expand title="NFPA"]
National Fire Protection Association[/expand]
[expand title="NIOSH"]
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health[/expand]
[expand title="NRC"]
Nuclear Regulatory Commission[/expand]
[expand title="OSHA"]
Occupational Safety and Health Administration[/expand]
[expand title="OSH Act"]
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655, 657, 665).[/expand]
[expand title="PAPR"]
A Powered Air-Purifying Respirator (PARP) is an air-purifying respirator that uses a blower to force the ambient air through air-purifying elements to the inlet covering.[/expand]
[expand title="PEL"]
Permissible Exposure Limit. An occupational exposure limit specified by OSHA.[/expand]
[expand title="PPF"]
A Program Protection Factor (PPF) study is a study that determines the protection provided by a respirator during use. This determination generally is accomplished by measuring the ratio of the concentration of an airborne contaminant (e.g., hazardous substance) outside the respirator (Co) to the concentration inside the respirator (Ci) (i.e., Co/Ci). Therefore, as the ratio between Co and Ci increases, the protection factor increases, indicating an increase in the level of protection provided to employees by the respirator. There are four types of protection factor studies: EPF, PPF, WPF, and SWPF.[/expand]
[expand title="QLFT"]
A Qualitative Fit Test (QLFT) is a pass/fail fit test to assess the adequacy of respirator fit that relies on the individual’s response to the test agent.[/expand]
[expand title="QNFT"]
A Quantitative Fit Test (QNFT) is an assessment of the adequacy of respirator fit by numerically measuring the amount of leakage into the respirator.[/expand]
[expand title="RDL"]
Respirator Decision Logic. Respirator selection guidance developed by NIOSH that contains a set of respirator protection factors.[/expand]
[expand title="REL"]
Recommended Exposure Limit. An occupational exposure level recommended by NIOSH.[/expand]
[expand title="SAR"]
A Supplied-Air (or Airline) Respirator (SAR) is an atmosphere-supplying respirator for which the source of breathing air is not designed to be carried by the user.[/expand]
[expand title="SCBA"]
A Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) is an atmosphere- supplying respirator for which the breathing air source is designed to be carried by the user.[/expand]
[expand title="SWPF"]
A Simulated Workplace Protection Factor (SWPF) study is a study, conducted in a controlled laboratory setting and in which Co and Ci sampling is performed while the respirator user performs a series of set exercises. The laboratory setting is used to control many of the variables found in workplace studies, while the exercises simulate the work activities of respirator users. This type of study is designed to determine the optimum performance of respirators by reducing the impact of sources of variability through maintenance of tightly controlled study conditions.[/expand]
[expand title="TLV"]
Threshold Limit Value. An occupational exposure level recommended by the ACGIH (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists).[/expand]
[expand title="TWA"]
Time-Weighted Average is used to measure a worker's daily exposure to hazardous substances, averaged on an 8-hour workday. The average is calculated from air samples throughout a work cycle and the amount of time spent working in those conditions. OSHA uses TWAs to establish <em>Permissible Exposure Limits</em> for the contaminants encountered in industries.
The TWA is calculated in units of parts per million (ppm) or mg/m3.[/expand]
[expand title="WPF"]
A Workplace Protection Factor (WPF) study is a study, conducted under actual conditions of use in the workplace, that measures the protection provided by a properly selected, fit-tested, and functioning respirator, when the respirator is worn correctly and used as part of a comprehensive respirator program that is in compliance with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard at 29 CFR 1910.134. Measurements of Co and Ci are obtained only while the respirator is being worn during performance of normal work tasks (i.e., samples are not collected when the respirator is not being worn). As the degree of protection afforded by the respirator increases, the WPF increases.[/expand]]]></content:encoded>

A study, conducted under actual conditions of use in the workplace, that measures the protection provided by a properly selected, fit-tested, and functioning respirator, when the respirator is worn correctly and used as part of a comprehensive respirator program that is in compliance with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard at <a href="https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=12716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29 CFR 1910.134</a>. Measurements of Co (Concentration outside) and Ci (Concentration inside) are obtained only while the respirator is being worn during performance of normal work tasks (i.e., samples are not collected when the respirator is not being worn). As the degree of protection afforded by the respirator increases, the WPF increases.[/expand]

[expand title="Simulated Workplace Protection Factor (SWPF) study"]
A study, conducted in a controlled laboratory setting and in which Co and Ci sampling is performed while the respirator user performs a series of set exercises. The laboratory setting is used to control many of the variables found in workplace studies, while the exercises simulate the work activities of respirator users. This type of study is designed to determine the optimum performance of respirators by reducing the impact of sources of variability through maintenance of tightly controlled study conditions.[/expand]

[expand title="Qualitative fit test (QLFT)"]
A pass/fail fit test to assess the adequacy of respirator fit that relies on the individual’s response to the test agent.[/expand]

[expand title="Quantitative fit test (QNFT)"]
An assessment of the adequacy of respirator fit by numerically measuring the amount of leakage into the respirator.[/expand]

[expand title="Recommended Exposure Limit (REL)"]
An occupational exposure level recommended by NIOSH.[/expand]

[expand title="Respirator Decision Logic (RDL)"]
Respirator selection guidance developed by NIOSH that contains a set of respirator protection factors.[/expand]

[expand title="Respiratory inlet covering"]
That portion of a respirator that forms the protective barrier between the user’s respiratory tract and an air-purifying device or breathing air source, or both. It may be a facepiece, helmet, hood, suit, or a mouthpiece respirator with nose clamp.[/expand]

[expand title="Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)"]
An atmosphere- supplying respirator for which the breathing air source is designed to be carried by the user.[/expand]

[expand title="Supplied-air respirator (or airline) respirator (SAR)"]
An atmosphere-supplying respirator for which the source of breathing air is not designed to be carried by the user.[/expand]

[expand title="Threshold Limit Value (TLV)"]
An occupational exposure level recommended by the ACGIH (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists).[/expand]

[expand title="Tight-fitting facepiece"]
A respiratory inlet covering that forms a complete seal with the face.[/expand]

[expand title="Time-weighted average (TWA)"]
Time-Weighted Average is used to measure a worker's daily exposure to hazardous substances, averaged on an 8-hour workday. The average is calculated from air samples throughout a work cycle and the amount of time spent working in those conditions. OSHA uses TWAs to establish <em>Permissible Exposure Limits</em> for the contaminants encountered in industries.
The TWA is calculated in units of parts per million (ppm) or mg/m3.[/expand]

[expand title="User seal check"]
An action conducted by the respirator user to determine if the respirator is properly seated to the face.[/expand]]]></content:encoded>

Instead, these respirators are selected based on a consideration of the time needed to escape, and the likelihood of IDLH or oxygen deficiency conditions.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[PART I. OSHA-ACCEPTED FIT TEST PROTOCOLS 
The employer shall conduct fit testing using the following procedures. The requirements in this appendix apply to all OSHA-accepted fit test methods, both QLFT and QNFT.

[expand title="A. Fit Testing Procedures -- General Requirements"] 

The employer shall conduct fit testing using the following procedures. The requirements in this appendix apply to all OSHA-accepted fit test methods, both QLFT and QNFT. 

1. The test subject shall be allowed to pick the most acceptable respirator from a sufficient number of respirator models and sizes so that the respirator is acceptable to, and correctly fits, the user. 

2. Prior to the selection process, the test subject shall be shown how to put on a respirator, how it should be positioned on the face, how to set strap tension and how to determine an acceptable fit. A mirror shall be available to assist the subject in evaluating the fit and positioning of the respirator. This instruction may not constitute the subject's formal training on respirator use, because it is only a review. 

3. The test subject shall be informed that he/she is being asked to select the respirator that provides the most acceptable fit. Each respirator represents a different size and shape, and if fitted and used properly, will provide adequate protection. 

4. The test subject shall be instructed to hold each chosen facepiece up to the face and eliminate those that obviously do not give an acceptable fit. 

5. The more acceptable facepieces are noted in case the one selected proves unacceptable; the most comfortable mask is donned and worn at least five minutes to assess comfort. Assistance in assessing comfort can be given by discussing the points in the following item A.6. If the test subject is not familiar with using a particular respirator, the test subject shall be directed to don the mask several times and to adjust the straps each time to become adept at setting proper tension on the straps. 

6. Assessment of comfort shall include a review of the following points with the test subject and allowing the test subject adequate time to determine the comfort of the respirator:
(a) Position of the mask on the nose 
(b) Room for eye protection 
(c) Room to talk 
(d) Position of mask on face and cheeks

7. The following criteria shall be used to help determine the adequacy of the respirator fit:
(a) Chin properly placed; 
(b) Adequate strap tension, not overly tightened; 
(c) Fit across nose bridge; 
(d) Respirator of proper size to span distance from nose to chin; 
(e) Tendency of respirator to slip; 
(f) Self-observation in mirror to evaluate fit and respirator position.

8. The test subject shall conduct a user seal check, either the negative and positive pressure seal checks described in Appendix B-1 of this section or those recommended by the respirator manufacturer which provide equivalent protection to the procedures in Appendix B-1. Before conducting the negative and positive pressure checks, the subject shall be told to seat the mask on the face by moving the head from side-to-side and up and down slowly while taking in a few slow deep breaths. Another facepiece shall be selected and retested if the test subject fails the user seal check tests. 

9. The test shall not be conducted if there is any hair growth between the skin and the facepiece sealing surface, such as stubble beard growth, beard, mustache or sideburns which cross the respirator sealing surface. Any type of apparel which interferes with a satisfactory fit shall be altered or removed. 

10. If a test subject exhibits difficulty in breathing during the tests, she or he shall be referred to a physician or other licensed health care professional, as appropriate, to determine whether the test subject can wear a respirator while performing her or his duties. 

11. If the employee finds the fit of the respirator unacceptable, the test subject shall be given the opportunity to select a different respirator and to be retested. 

12. Exercise regimen. Prior to the commencement of the fit test, the test subject shall be given a description of the fit test and the test subject's responsibilities during the test procedure. The description of the process shall include a description of the test exercises that the subject will be performing. The respirator to be tested shall be worn for at least 5 minutes before the start of the fit test. 

13. The fit test shall be performed while the test subject is wearing any applicable safety equipment that may be worn during actual respirator use which could interfere with respirator fit.[/expand] 

[expand title="14. Test Exercises for All Fit Testing Methods"]

(a) Employers must perform the following test exercises for all fit testing methods prescribed in this appendix, except for the CNP quantitative fit testing protocol and the CNP REDON quantitative fit testing protocol. For these two protocols, employers must ensure that the test subjects (i.e., employees) perform the exercise procedure specified in Part I.C.4(b) of this appendix for the CNP quantitative fit testing protocol, or the exercise procedure described in Part I.C.5(b) of this appendix for the CNP REDON quantitative fit-testing protocol. For the remaining fit testing methods, employers must ensure that employees perform the test exercises in the appropriate test environment in the following manner:

<strong>(1) Normal breathing.</strong> In a normal standing position, without talking, the subject shall breathe normally. 

<strong>(2) Deep breathing.</strong> In a normal standing position, the subject shall breathe slowly and deeply, taking caution so as not to hyperventilate. 

<strong>(3) Turning head side to side.</strong> Standing in place, the subject shall slowly turn his/her head from side to side between the extreme positions on each side. The head shall be held at each extreme momentarily so the subject can inhale at each side. 

<strong>(4) Moving head up and down.</strong> Standing in place, the subject shall slowly move his/her head up and down. The subject shall be instructed to inhale in the up position (i.e., when looking toward the ceiling). 

<strong>(5) Talking.</strong> The subject shall talk out loud slowly and loud enough so as to be heard clearly by the test conductor. The subject can read from a prepared text such as the Rainbow Passage, count backward from 100, or recite a memorized poem or song. 


<strong>Rainbow Passage;</strong> “When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act like a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.”


<strong>(6) Grimace.</strong> The test subject shall grimace by smiling or frowning. (This applies only to QNFT testing; it is not performed for QLFT) 

<strong>(7) Bending over.</strong> The test subject shall bend at the waist as if he/she were to touch his/her toes. Jogging in place shall be substituted for this exercise in those test environments such as shroud type QNFT or QLFT units that do not permit bending over at the waist. 

<strong>(8) Normal breathing.</strong> Same as exercise (1).

(b) Each test exercise shall be performed for one minute except for the grimace exercise which shall be performed for 15 seconds. The test subject shall be questioned by the test conductor regarding the comfort of the respirator upon completion of the protocol. If it has become unacceptable, another model of respirator shall be tried. The respirator shall not be adjusted once the fit test exercises begin. Any adjustment voids the test, and the fit test must be repeated.[/expand]

[expand title="B. Qualitative Fit Test (QLFT) Protocols"] 

<strong>1. General</strong>
1(a) The employer shall ensure that persons administering QLFT are able to prepare test solutions, calibrate equipment and perform tests properly, recognize invalid tests, and ensure that test equipment is in proper working order. 

1(b) The employer shall ensure that QLFT equipment is kept clean and well maintained so as to operate within the parameters for which it was designed.[/expand]

[expand title="2. Isoamyl Acetate Protocol"]

Note: This protocol is not appropriate to use for the fit testing of particulate respirators. If used to fit test particulate respirators, the respirator must be equipped with an organic vapor filter.

<strong>2(a) Odor Threshold Screening</strong> 

Odor threshold screening, performed without wearing a respirator, is intended to determine if the individual tested can detect the odor of isoamyl acetate at low levels.

(1) Three 1 liter glass jars with metal lids are required. 

(2) Odor-free water (e.g., distilled or spring water) at approximately 25 deg. C (77 deg. F) shall be used for the solutions. 

(3) The isoamyl acetate (IAA) (also known at isopentyl acetate) stock solution is prepared by adding 1 ml of pure IAA to 800 ml of odor-free water in a 1 liter jar, closing the lid and shaking for 30 seconds. A new solution shall be prepared at least weekly. 

(4) The screening test shall be conducted in a room separate from the room used for actual fit testing. The two rooms shall be well-ventilated to prevent the odor of IAA from becoming evident in the general room air where testing takes place. 

(5) The odor test solution is prepared in a second jar by placing 0.4 ml of the stock solution into 500 ml of odor-free water using a clean dropper or pipette. The solution shall be shaken for 30 seconds and allowed to stand for two to three minutes so that the IAA concentration above the liquid may reach equilibrium. This solution shall be used for only one day. 

(6) A test blank shall be prepared in a third jar by adding 500 cc of odor-free water. 

(7) The odor test and test blank jar lids shall be labeled (e.g., 1 and 2) for jar identification. Labels shall be placed on the lids so that they can be peeled off periodically and switched to maintain the integrity of the test. 

(8) The following instruction shall be typed on a card and placed on the table in front of the two test jars (i.e., 1 and 2): "The purpose of this test is to determine if you can smell banana oil at a low concentration. The two bottles in front of you contain water. One of these bottles also contains a small amount of banana oil. Be sure the covers are on tight, then shake each bottle for two seconds. Unscrew the lid of each bottle, one at a time, and sniff at the mouth of the bottle. Indicate to the test conductor which bottle contains banana oil." 

(9) The mixtures used in the IAA odor detection test shall be prepared in an area separate from where the test is performed, in order to prevent olfactory fatigue in the subject. 

(10) If the test subject is unable to correctly identify the jar containing the odor test solution, the IAA qualitative fit test shall not be performed. 

(11) If the test subject correctly identifies the jar containing the odor test solution, the test subject may proceed to respirator selection and fit testing.

<strong>2(b) Isoamyl Acetate Fit Test</strong>

(1) The fit test chamber shall be a clear 55-gallon drum liner suspended inverted over a 2-foot diameter frame so that the top of the chamber is about 6 inches above the test subject's head. If no drum liner is available, a similar chamber shall be constructed using plastic sheeting. The inside top center of the chamber shall have a small hook attached. 

(2) Each respirator used for the fitting and fit testing shall be equipped with organic vapor cartridges or offer protection against organic vapors. 

(3) After selecting, donning, and properly adjusting a respirator, the test subject shall wear it to the fit testing room. This room shall be separate from the room used for odor threshold screening and respirator selection, and shall be well-ventilated, as by an exhaust fan or lab hood, to prevent general room contamination. 

(4) A copy of the test exercises and any prepared text from which the subject is to read shall be taped to the inside of the test chamber. 

(5) Upon entering the test chamber, the test subject shall be given a 6-inch by 5-inch piece of paper towel, or other porous, absorbent, single-ply material, folded in half and wetted with 0.75 ml of pure IAA. The test subject shall hang the wet towel on the hook at the top of the chamber. An IAA test swab or ampule may be substituted for the IAA wetted paper towel provided it has been demonstrated that the alternative IAA source will generate an IAA test atmosphere with a concentration equivalent to that generated by the paper towel method. 

(6) Allow two minutes for the IAA test concentration to stabilize before starting the fit test exercises. This would be an appropriate time to talk with the test subject; to explain the fit test, the importance of his/her cooperation, and the purpose for the test exercises; or to demonstrate some of the exercises. 

(7) If at any time during the test, the subject detects the banana-like odor of IAA, the test is failed. The subject shall quickly exit from the test chamber and leave the test area to avoid olfactory fatigue. 

(8) If the test is failed, the subject shall return to the selection room and remove the respirator. The test subject shall repeat the odor sensitivity test, select and put on another respirator, return to the test area and again begin the fit test procedure described in (b) (1) through (7) above. The process continues until a respirator that fits well has been found. Should the odor sensitivity test be failed, the subject shall wait at least 5 minutes before retesting. Odor sensitivity will usually have returned by this time. 

(9) If the subject passes the test, the efficiency of the test procedure shall be demonstrated by having the subject break the respirator face seal and take a breath before exiting the chamber. 

(10) When the test subject leaves the chamber, the subject shall remove the saturated towel and return it to the person conducting the test, so that there is no significant IAA concentration buildup in the chamber during subsequent tests. The used towels shall be kept in a self-sealing plastic bag to keep the test area from being contaminated.[/expand]

[expand title="3. Saccharin Solution Aerosol Protocol"]

The entire screening and testing procedure shall be explained to the test subject prior to the conduct of the screening test.

<strong>(a) Taste Threshold Screening</strong>

The saccharin taste threshold screening, performed without wearing a respirator, is intended to determine whether the individual being tested can detect the taste of saccharin.

(1) During threshold screening as well as during fit testing, subjects shall wear an enclosure about the head and shoulders that is approximately 12 inches in diameter by 14 inches tall with at least the front portion clear and that allows free movements of the head when a respirator is worn. An enclosure substantially similar to the 3M hood assembly, parts # FT 14 and # FT 15 combined, is adequate. 

(2) The test enclosure shall have a 3/4-inch (1.9 cm) hole in front of the test subject's nose and mouth area to accommodate the nebulizer nozzle. 

(3) The test subject shall don the test enclosure. Throughout the threshold screening test, the test subject shall breathe through his/her slightly open mouth with tongue extended. The subject is instructed to report when he/she detects a sweet taste. 

(4) Using a DeVilbiss Model 40 Inhalation Medication Nebulizer or equivalent, the test conductor shall spray the threshold check solution into the enclosure. The nozzle is directed away from the nose and mouth of the person. This nebulizer shall be clearly marked to distinguish it from the fit test solution nebulizer. 

(5) The threshold check solution is prepared by dissolving 0.83 gram of sodium saccharin USP in 100 ml of warm water. It can be prepared by putting 1 ml of the fit test solution (see (b)(5) below) in 100 ml of distilled water. 

(6) To produce the aerosol, the nebulizer bulb is firmly squeezed so that it collapses completely, then released and allowed to fully expand. 

(7) Ten squeezes are repeated rapidly and then the test subject is asked whether the saccharin can be tasted. If the test subject reports tasting the sweet taste during the ten squeezes, the screening test is completed. The taste threshold is noted as ten regardless of the number of squeezes actually completed. 

(8) If the first response is negative, ten more squeezes are repeated rapidly and the test subject is again asked whether the saccharin is tasted. If the test subject reports tasting the sweet taste during the second ten squeezes, the screening test is completed. The taste threshold is noted as twenty regardless of the number of squeezes actually completed. 

(9) If the second response is negative, ten more squeezes are repeated rapidly and the test subject is again asked whether the saccharin is tasted. If the test subject reports tasting the sweet taste during the third set of ten squeezes, the screening test is completed. The taste threshold is noted as thirty regardless of the number of squeezes actually completed. 

(10) The test conductor will take note of the number of squeezes required to solicit a taste response. 

(11) If the saccharin is not tasted after 30 squeezes (step 10), the test subject is unable to taste saccharin and may not perform the saccharin fit test. 

Note to paragraph 3(a): If the test subject eats or drinks something sweet before the screening test, he/she may be unable to taste the weak saccharin solution. 

(12) If a taste response is elicited, the test subject shall be asked to take note of the taste for reference in the fit test. 

(13) Correct use of the nebulizer means that approximately 1 ml of liquid is used at a time in the nebulizer body. 

(14) The nebulizer shall be thoroughly rinsed in water, shaken dry, and refilled at least each morning and afternoon or at least every four hours.

<strong>(b) Saccharin Solution Aerosol Fit Test Procedure</strong>

(1) The test subject may not eat, drink (except plain water), smoke, or chew gum for 15 minutes before the test. 

(2) The fit test uses the same enclosure described in 3. (a) above. 

(3) The test subject shall don the enclosure while wearing the respirator selected in section I. A. of this appendix. The respirator shall be properly adjusted and equipped with a particulate filter(s). 

(4) A second DeVilbiss Model 40 Inhalation Medication Nebulizer or equivalent is used to spray the fit test solution into the enclosure. This nebulizer shall be clearly marked to distinguish it from the screening test solution nebulizer. 

(5) The fit test solution is prepared by adding 83 grams of sodium saccharin to 100 ml of warm water. 

(6) As before, the test subject shall breathe through the slightly open mouth with tongue extended, and report if he/she tastes the sweet taste of saccharin. 

(7) The nebulizer is inserted into the hole in the front of the enclosure and an initial concentration of saccharin fit test solution is sprayed into the enclosure using the same number of squeezes (either 10, 20 or 30 squeezes) based on the number of squeezes required to elicit a taste response as noted during the screening test. A minimum of 10 squeezes is required. 

(8) After generating the aerosol, the test subject shall be instructed to perform the exercises in section I. A. 14. of this appendix. 

(9) Every 30 seconds the aerosol concentration shall be replenished using one half the original number of squeezes used initially (e.g., 5, 10 or 15). 

(10) The test subject shall indicate to the test conductor if at any time during the fit test the taste of saccharin is detected. If the test subject does not report tasting the saccharin, the test is passed. 

(11) If the taste of saccharin is detected, the fit is deemed unsatisfactory and the test is failed. A different respirator shall be tried and the entire test procedure is repeated (taste threshold screening and fit testing). 

(12) Since the nebulizer has a tendency to clog during use, the test operator must make periodic checks of the nebulizer to ensure that it is not clogged. If clogging is found at the end of the test session, the test is invalid.[/expand]

[expand title="4. Bitrex (Denatonium Benzoate) Solution Aerosol Qualitative Fit Test Protocol"]

The Bitrex (Denatonium benzoate) solution aerosol QLFT protocol uses the published saccharin test protocol because that protocol is widely accepted. Bitrex is routinely used as a taste aversion agent in household liquids which children should not be drinking and is endorsed by the American Medical Association, the National Safety Council, and the American Association of Poison Control Centers. The entire screening and testing procedure shall be explained to the test subject prior to the conduct of the screening test.

<strong>(a) Taste Threshold Screening</strong>

The Bitrex taste threshold screening, performed without wearing a respirator, is intended to determine whether the individual being tested can detect the taste of Bitrex.

(1) During threshold screening as well as during fit testing, subjects shall wear an enclosure about the head and shoulders that is approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm) in diameter by 14 inches (35.6 cm) tall. The front portion of the enclosure shall be clear from the respirator and allow free movement of the head when a respirator is worn. An enclosure substantially similar to the 3M hood assembly, parts # FT 14 and # FT 15 combined, is adequate. 

(2) The test enclosure shall have a \3/4\ inch (1.9 cm) hole in front of the test subject's nose and mouth area to accommodate the nebulizer nozzle. 

(3) The test subject shall don the test enclosure. Throughout the threshold screening test, the test subject shall breathe through his or her slightly open mouth with tongue extended. The subject is instructed to report when he/she detects a bitter taste 

(4) Using a DeVilbiss Model 40 Inhalation Medication Nebulizer or equivalent, the test conductor shall spray the Threshold Check Solution into the enclosure. This Nebulizer shall be clearly marked to distinguish it from the fit test solution nebulizer. 

(5) The Threshold Check Solution is prepared by adding 13.5 milligrams of Bitrex to 100 ml of 5% salt (NaCl) solution in distilled water. 

(6) To produce the aerosol, the nebulizer bulb is firmly squeezed so that the bulb collapses completely, and is then released and allowed to fully expand. 

(7) An initial ten squeezes are repeated rapidly and then the test subject is asked whether the Bitrex can be tasted. If the test subject reports tasting the bitter taste during the ten squeezes, the screening test is completed. The taste threshold is noted as ten regardless of the number of squeezes actually completed. 

(8) If the first response is negative, ten more squeezes are repeated rapidly and the test subject is again asked whether the Bitrex is tasted. If the test subject reports tasting the bitter taste during the second ten squeezes, the screening test is completed. The taste threshold is noted as twenty regardless of the number of squeezes actually completed. 

(9) If the second response is negative, ten more squeezes are repeated rapidly and the test subject is again asked whether the Bitrex is tasted. If the test subject reports tasting the bitter taste during the third set of ten squeezes, the screening test is completed. The taste threshold is noted as thirty regardless of the number of squeezes actually completed. 

(10) The test conductor will take note of the number of squeezes required to solicit a taste response. 

(11) If the Bitrex is not tasted after 30 squeezes (step 10), the test subject is unable to taste Bitrex and may not perform the Bitrex fit test. 

(12) If a taste response is elicited, the test subject shall be asked to take note of the taste for reference in the fit test. 

(13) Correct use of the nebulizer means that approximately 1 ml of liquid is used at a time in the nebulizer body. 

(14) The nebulizer shall be thoroughly rinsed in water, shaken to dry, and refilled at least each morning and afternoon or at least every four hours.

<strong>(b) Bitrex Solution Aerosol Fit Test Procedure</strong>

(1) The test subject may not eat, drink (except plain water), smoke, or chew gum for 15 minutes before the test. 

(2) The fit test uses the same enclosure as that described in 4. (a) above. 

(3) The test subject shall don the enclosure while wearing the respirator selected according to section I. A. of this appendix. The respirator shall be properly adjusted and equipped with any type particulate filter(s). 

(4) A second DeVilbiss Model 40 Inhalation Medication Nebulizer or equivalent is used to spray the fit test solution into the enclosure. This nebulizer shall be clearly marked to distinguish it from the screening test solution nebulizer. 

(5) The fit test solution is prepared by adding 337.5 mg of Bitrex to 200 ml of a 5% salt (NaCl) solution in warm water. 

(6) As before, the test subject shall breathe through his or her slightly open mouth with tongue extended, and be instructed to report if he/she tastes the bitter taste of Bitrex. 

(7) The nebulizer is inserted into the hole in the front of the enclosure and an initial concentration of the fit test solution is sprayed into the enclosure using the same number of squeezes (either 10, 20 or 30 squeezes) based on the number of squeezes required to elicit a taste response as noted during the screening test. 

(8) After generating the aerosol, the test subject shall be instructed to perform the exercises in section I. A. 14. of this appendix. 

(9) Every 30 seconds the aerosol concentration shall be replenished using one half the number of squeezes used initially (e.g., 5, 10 or 15). 

(10) The test subject shall indicate to the test conductor if at any time during the fit test the taste of Bitrex is detected. If the test subject does not report tasting the Bitrex, the test is passed. 

(11) If the taste of Bitrex is detected, the fit is deemed unsatisfactory and the test is failed. A different respirator shall be tried and the entire test procedure is repeated (taste threshold screening and fit testing).[/expand]

[expand title="5. Irritant Smoke (Stannic Chloride) Protocol"]

This qualitative fit test uses a person's response to the irritating chemicals released in the "smoke" produced by a stannic chloride ventilation smoke tube to detect leakage into the respirator.

<strong>(a) General Requirements and Precautions</strong>

(1) The respirator to be tested shall be equipped with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) or P100 series filter(s). 

(2) Only stannic chloride smoke tubes shall be used for this protocol. 

(3) No form of test enclosure or hood for the test subject shall be used. 

(4) The smoke can be irritating to the eyes, lungs, and nasal passages. The test conductor shall take precautions to minimize the test subject's exposure to irritant smoke. Sensitivity varies, and certain individuals may respond to a greater degree to irritant smoke. Care shall be taken when performing the sensitivity screening checks that determine whether the test subject can detect irritant smoke to use only the minimum amount of smoke necessary to elicit a response from the test subject. 

(5) The fit test shall be performed in an area with adequate ventilation to prevent exposure of the person conducting the fit test or the build-up of irritant smoke in the general atmosphere.

<strong>(b) Sensitivity Screening Check </strong>

The person to be tested must demonstrate his or her ability to detect a weak concentration of the irritant smoke.

(1) The test operator shall break both ends of a ventilation smoke tube containing stannic chloride, and attach one end of the smoke tube to a low flow air pump set to deliver 200 milliliters per minute, or an aspirator squeeze bulb. The test operator shall cover the other end of the smoke tube with a short piece of tubing to prevent potential injury from the jagged end of the smoke tube. 

(2) The test operator shall advise the test subject that the smoke can be irritating to the eyes, lungs, and nasal passages and instruct the subject to keep his/her eyes closed while the test is performed. 

(3) The test subject shall be allowed to smell a weak concentration of the irritant smoke before the respirator is donned to become familiar with its irritating properties and to determine if he/she can detect the irritating properties of the smoke. The test operator shall carefully direct a small amount of the irritant smoke in the test subject's direction to determine that he/she can detect it.

<strong>(c) Irritant Smoke Fit Test Procedure</strong>

(1) The person being fit tested shall don the respirator without assistance, and perform the required user seal check(s). 

(2) The test subject shall be instructed to keep his/her eyes closed. 

(3) The test operator shall direct the stream of irritant smoke from the smoke tube toward the faceseal area of the test subject, using the low flow pump or the squeeze bulb. The test operator shall begin at least 12 inches from the facepiece and move the smoke stream around the whole perimeter of the mask. The operator shall gradually make two more passes around the perimeter of the mask, moving to within six inches of the respirator. 

(4) If the person being tested has not had an involuntary response and/or detected the irritant smoke, proceed with the test exercises. 

(5) The exercises identified in section I.A. 14. of this appendix shall be performed by the test subject while the respirator seal is being continually challenged by the smoke, directed around the perimeter of the respirator at a distance of six inches. 

(6) If the person being fit tested reports detecting the irritant smoke at any time, the test is failed. The person being retested must repeat the entire sensitivity check and fit test procedure. 

(7) Each test subject passing the irritant smoke test without evidence of a response (involuntary cough, irritation) shall be given a second sensitivity screening check, with the smoke from the same smoke tube used during the fit test, once the respirator has been removed, to determine whether he/she still reacts to the smoke. Failure to evoke a response shall void the fit test. 

(8) If a response is produced during this second sensitivity check, then the fit test is passed.[/expand]

[expand title="C. Quantitative Fit Test (QNFT) Protocols"]

The following quantitative fit testing procedures have been demonstrated to be acceptable: Quantitative fit testing using a non-hazardous test aerosol (such as corn oil, polyethylene glycol 400 [PEG 400], di-2-ethyl hexyl sebacate [DEHS], or sodium chloride) generated in a test chamber, and employing instrumentation to quantify the fit of the respirator; Quantitative fit testing using ambient aerosol as the test agent and appropriate instrumentation (condensation nuclei counter) to quantify the respirator fit; Quantitative fit testing using controlled negative pressure and appropriate instrumentation to measure the volumetric leak rate of a facepiece to quantify the respirator fit. 

<strong>1. General</strong>

(a) The employer shall ensure that persons administering QNFT are able to calibrate equipment and perform tests properly, recognize invalid tests, calculate fit factors properly and ensure that test equipment is in proper working order. 

(b) The employer shall ensure that QNFT equipment is kept clean, and is maintained and calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions so as to operate at the parameters for which it was designed.[/expand]

[expand title="2. Generated Aerosol Quantitative Fit Testing Protocol"]

<strong>(a) Apparatus.</strong>

(1) Instrumentation. Aerosol generation, dilution, and measurement systems using particulates (corn oil, polyethylene glycol 400 [PEG 400], di-2-ethyl hexyl sebacate [DEHS] or sodium chloride) as test aerosols shall be used for quantitative fit testing. 

(2) Test chamber. The test chamber shall be large enough to permit all test subjects to perform freely all required exercises without disturbing the test agent concentration or the measurement apparatus. The test chamber shall be equipped and constructed so that the test agent is effectively isolated from the ambient air, yet uniform in concentration throughout the chamber. 

(3) When testing air-purifying respirators, the normal filter or cartridge element shall be replaced with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) or P100 series filter supplied by the same manufacturer. 

(4) The sampling instrument shall be selected so that a computer record or strip chart record may be made of the test showing the rise and fall of the test agent concentration with each inspiration and expiration at fit factors of at least 2,000. Integrators or computers that integrate the amount of test agent penetration leakage into the respirator for each exercise may be used provided a record of the readings is made. 

(5) The combination of substitute air-purifying elements, test agent and test agent concentration shall be such that the test subject is not exposed in excess of an established exposure limit for the test agent at any time during the testing process, based upon the length of the exposure and the exposure limit duration. 

(6) The sampling port on the test specimen respirator shall be placed and constructed so that no leakage occurs around the port (e.g., where the respirator is probed), a free air flow is allowed into the sampling line at all times, and there is no interference with the fit or performance of the respirator. The in-mask sampling device (probe) shall be designed and used so that the air sample is drawn from the breathing zone of the test subject, midway between the nose and mouth and with the probe extending into the facepiece cavity at least 1/4 inch. 

(7) The test setup shall permit the person administering the test to observe the test subject inside the chamber during the test. 

(8) The equipment generating the test atmosphere shall maintain the concentration of test agent constant to within a 10 percent variation for the duration of the test. 

(9) The time lag (interval between an event and the recording of the event on the strip chart or computer or integrator) shall be kept to a minimum. There shall be a clear association between the occurrence of an event and its being recorded. 

(10) The sampling line tubing for the test chamber atmosphere and for the respirator sampling port shall be of equal diameter and of the same material. The length of the two lines shall be equal. 

(11) The exhaust flow from the test chamber shall pass through an appropriate filter (i.e., high efficiency particulate filter) before release. 

(12) When sodium chloride aerosol is used, the relative humidity inside the test chamber shall not exceed 50 percent. 

(13) The limitations of instrument detection shall be taken into account when determining the fit factor. 

(14) Test respirators shall be maintained in proper working order and be inspected regularly for deficiencies such as cracks or missing valves and gaskets.

<strong>(b) Procedural Requirements</strong>

(1) When performing the initial user seal check using a positive or negative pressure check, the sampling line shall be crimped closed in order to avoid air pressure leakage during either of these pressure checks. 

(2) The use of an abbreviated screening QLFT test is optional. Such a test may be utilized in order to quickly identify poor fitting respirators that passed the positive and/or negative pressure test and reduce the amount of QNFT time. The use of the CNC QNFT instrument in the count mode is another optional method to obtain a quick estimate of fit and eliminate poor fitting respirators before going on to perform a full QNFT. 

(3) A reasonably stable test agent concentration shall be measured in the test chamber prior to testing. For canopy or shower curtain types of test units, the determination of the test agent's stability may be established after the test subject has entered the test environment. 

(4) Immediately after the subject enters the test chamber, the test agent concentration inside the respirator shall be measured to ensure that the peak penetration does not exceed 5 percent for a half mask or 1 percent for a full facepiece respirator. 

(5) A stable test agent concentration shall be obtained prior to the actual start of testing. 

(6) Respirator restraining straps shall not be over-tightened for testing. The straps shall be adjusted by the wearer without assistance from other persons to give a reasonably comfortable fit typical of normal use. The respirator shall not be adjusted once the fit test exercises begin. 

(7) The test shall be terminated whenever any single peak penetration exceeds 5 percent for half masks and 1 percent for full facepiece respirators. The test subject shall be refitted and retested. 

(8) Calculation of fit factors.
(i) The fit factor shall be determined for the quantitative fit test by taking the ratio of the average chamber concentration to the concentration measured inside the respirator for each test exercise except the grimace exercise. 

(ii) The average test chamber concentration shall be calculated as the arithmetic average of the concentration measured before and after each test (i.e., 7 exercises) or the arithmetic average of the concentration measured before and after each exercise or the true average measured continuously during the respirator sample. 

(iii) The concentration of the challenge agent inside the respirator shall be determined by one of the following methods: 


<strong>(A)</strong> Average peak penetration method means the method of determining test agent penetration into the respirator utilizing a strip chart recorder, integrator, or computer. The agent penetration is determined by an average of the peak heights on the graph or by computer integration, for each exercise except the grimace exercise. Integrators or computers that calculate the actual test agent penetration into the respirator for each exercise will also be considered to meet the requirements of the average peak penetration method. 

<strong>(B)</strong> Maximum peak penetration method means the method of determining test agent penetration in the respirator as determined by strip chart recordings of the test. The highest peak penetration for a given exercise is taken to be representative of average penetration into the respirator for that exercise. 

<strong>(C)</strong> Integration by calculation of the area under the individual peak for each exercise except the grimace exercise. This includes computerized integration. 

<strong>(D)</strong> The calculation of the overall fit factor using individual exercise fit factors involves first converting the exercise fit factors to penetration values, determining the average, and then converting that result back to a fit factor. This procedure is described in the following equation:


  <img src="http://respirators101.iuoe-hazmat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Appendix-A-Respirators-equation.png" alt="" width="693" height="77" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-546" />

Where ff1, ff2, ff3, etc. are the fit factors for exercises 1, 2, 3, etc. 


(9) The test subject shall not be permitted to wear a half mask or quarter facepiece respirator unless a minimum fit factor of 100 is obtained, or a full facepiece respirator unless a minimum fit factor of 500 is obtained. 

(10) Filters used for quantitative fit testing shall be replaced whenever increased breathing resistance is encountered, or when the test agent has altered the integrity of the filter media.[/expand]

[expand title="3. Ambient Aerosol Condensation Nuclei Counter (CNC) Quantitative Fit Testing Protocol"]

The ambient aerosol condensation nuclei counter (CNC) quantitative fit testing (Portacount TM) protocol quantitatively fit tests respirators with the use of a probe. The probed respirator is only used for quantitative fit tests. A probed respirator has a special sampling device, installed on the respirator, that allows the probe to sample the air from inside the mask. A probed respirator is required for each make, style, model, and size that the employer uses and can be obtained from the respirator manufacturer or distributor. The CNC instrument manufacturer, TSI Inc., also provides probe attachments (TSI sampling adapters) that permit fit testing in an employee's own respirator. A minimum fit factor pass level of at least 100 is necessary for a half-mask respirator and a minimum fit factor pass level of at least 500 is required for a full facepiece negative pressure respirator. The entire screening and testing procedure shall be explained to the test subject prior to the conduct of the screening test.

<strong>(a) Portacount Fit Test Requirements</strong>

(1) Check the respirator to make sure the sampling probe and line are properly attached to the facepiece and that the respirator is fitted with a particulate filter capable of preventing significant penetration by the ambient particles used for the fit test (e.g., NIOSH 42 CFR 84 series 100, series 99, or series 95 particulate filter) per manufacturer's instruction. 

(2) Instruct the person to be tested to don the respirator for five minutes before the fit test starts. This purges the ambient particles trapped inside the respirator and permits the wearer to make certain the respirator is comfortable. This individual shall already have been trained on how to wear the respirator properly. 

(3) Check the following conditions for the adequacy of the respirator fit: Chin properly placed; Adequate strap tension, not overly tightened; Fit across nose bridge; Respirator of proper size to span distance from nose to chin; Tendency of the respirator to slip; Self-observation in a mirror to evaluate fit and respirator position. 

(4) Have the person wearing the respirator do a user seal check. If leakage is detected, determine the cause. If leakage is from a poorly fitting facepiece, try another size of the same model respirator, or another model of respirator. 

(5) Follow the manufacturer's instructions for operating the Portacount and proceed with the test. 

(6) The test subject shall be instructed to perform the exercises in section I. A. 14. of this appendix. 

(7) After the test exercises, the test subject shall be questioned by the test conductor regarding the comfort of the respirator upon completion of the protocol. If it has become unacceptable, another model of respirator shall be tried.

<strong>(b) Portacount Test Instrument</strong>

(1) The Portacount will automatically stop and calculate the overall fit factor for the entire set of exercises. The overall fit factor is what counts. The Pass or Fail message will indicate whether or not the test was successful. If the test was a Pass, the fit test is over. 

(2) Since the pass or fail criterion of the Portacount is user programmable, the test operator shall ensure that the pass or fail criterion meet the requirements for minimum respirator performance in this Appendix. 

(3) A record of the test needs to be kept on file, assuming the fit test was successful. The record must contain the test subject's name; overall fit factor; make, model, style, and size of respirator used; and date tested.[/expand]

[expand title="4. Controlled Negative Pressure (CNP) Quantitative Fit Testing Protocol"]

The CNP protocol provides an alternative to aerosol fit test methods. The CNP fit test method technology is based on exhausting air from a temporarily sealed respirator facepiece to generate and then maintain a constant negative pressure inside the facepiece. The rate of air exhaust is controlled so that a constant negative pressure is maintained in the respirator during the fit test. The level of pressure is selected to replicate the mean inspiratory pressure that causes leakage into the respirator under normal use conditions. With pressure held constant, air flow out of the respirator is equal to air flow into the respirator. Therefore, measurement of the exhaust stream that is required to hold the pressure in the temporarily sealed respirator constant yields a direct measure of leakage air flow into the respirator. The CNP fit test method measures leak rates through the facepiece as a method for determining the facepiece fit for negative pressure respirators. The CNP instrument manufacturer Occupational Health Dynamics of Birmingham, Alabama also provides attachments (sampling manifolds) that replace the filter cartridges to permit fit testing in an employee's own respirator. To perform the test, the test subject closes his or her mouth and holds his/her breath, after which an air pump removes air from the respirator facepiece at a pre-selected constant pressure. The facepiece fit is expressed as the leak rate through the facepiece, expressed as milliliters per minute. The quality and validity of the CNP fit tests are determined by the degree to which the in-mask pressure tracks the test pressure during the system measurement time of approximately five seconds. Instantaneous feedback in the form of a real-time pressure trace of the in-mask pressure is provided and used to determine test validity and quality. A minimum fit factor pass level of 100 is necessary for a half-mask respirator and a minimum fit factor of at least 500 is required for a full facepiece respirator. The entire screening and testing procedure shall be explained to the test subject prior to the conduct of the screening test.

<strong>(a) CNP Fit Test Requirements</strong>

(1) The instrument shall have a non-adjustable test pressure of 15.0 mm water pressure. 

(2) The CNP system defaults selected for test pressure shall be set at -- 15 mm of water (-0.58 inches of water) and the modeled inspiratory flow rate shall be 53.8 liters per minute for performing fit tests. 

(Note: CNP systems have built-in capability to conduct fit testing that is specific to unique work rate, mask, and gender situations that might apply in a specific workplace. Use of system default values, which were selected to represent respirator wear with medium cartridge resistance at a low-moderate work rate, will allow inter-test comparison of the respirator fit.) 

(3) The individual who conducts the CNP fit testing shall be thoroughly trained to perform the test. 

(4) The respirator filter or cartridge needs to be replaced with the CNP test manifold. The inhalation valve downstream from the manifold either needs to be temporarily removed or propped open. 

(5) The employer must train the test subject to hold his or her breath for at least 10 seconds. 

(6) The test subject must don the test respirator without any assistance from the test administrator who is conducting the CNP fit test. The respirator must not be adjusted once the fit-test exercises begin. Any adjustment voids the test, and the test subject must repeat the fit test. 

(7) The QNFT protocol shall be followed according to section I. C. 1. of this appendix with an exception for the CNP test exercises.

<strong>(b) CNP Test Exercises</strong>

(1) Normal breathing. In a normal standing position, without talking, the subject shall breathe normally for 1 minute. After the normal breathing exercise, the subject needs to hold head straight ahead and hold his or her breath for 10 seconds during the test measurement. 

(2) Deep breathing. In a normal standing position, the subject shall breathe slowly and deeply for 1 minute, being careful not to hyperventilate. After the deep breathing exercise, the subject shall hold his or her head straight ahead and hold his or her breath for 10 seconds during test measurement. 

(3) Turning head side to side. Standing in place, the subject shall slowly turn his or her head from side to side between the extreme positions on each side for 1 minute. The head shall be held at each extreme momentarily so the subject can inhale at each side. After the turning head side to side exercise, the subject needs to hold head full left and hold his or her breath for 10 seconds during test measurement. Next, the subject needs to hold head full right and hold his or her breath for 10 seconds during test measurement. 

(4) Moving head up and down. Standing in place, the subject shall slowly move his or her head up and down for 1 minute. The subject shall be instructed to inhale in the up position (i.e., when looking toward the ceiling). After the moving head up and down exercise, the subject shall hold his or her head full up and hold his or her breath for 10 seconds during test measurement. Next, the subject shall hold his or her head full down and hold his or her breath for 10 seconds during test measurement. 

(5) Talking. The subject shall talk out loud slowly and loud enough so as to be heard clearly by the test conductor. The subject can read from a prepared text such as the Rainbow Passage, count backward from 100, or recite a memorized poem or song for 1 minute. After the talking exercise, the subject shall hold his or her head straight ahead and hold his or her breath for 10 seconds during the test measurement. 

(6) Grimace. The test subject shall grimace by smiling or frowning for 15 seconds. 

(7) Bending Over. The test subject shall bend at the waist as if he or she were to touch his or her toes for 1 minute. Jogging in place shall be substituted for this exercise in those test environments such as shroud-type QNFT units that prohibit bending at the waist. After the bending over exercise, the subject shall hold his or her head straight ahead and hold his or her breath for 10 seconds during the test measurement. 

(8) Normal Breathing. The test subject shall remove and re-don the respirator within a one-minute period. Then, in a normal standing position, without talking, the subject shall breathe normally for 1 minute. After the normal breathing exercise, the subject shall hold his or her head straight ahead and hold his or her breath for 10 seconds during the test measurement. After the test exercises, the test subject shall be questioned by the test conductor regarding the comfort of the respirator upon completion of the protocol. If it has become unacceptable, another model of a respirator shall be tried.

<strong>(c) CNP Test Instrument</strong>

(1) The test instrument must have an effective audio-warning device, or a visual-warning device in the form of a screen tracing, that indicates when the test subject fails to hold his or her breath during the test. The test must be terminated and restarted from the beginning when the test subject fails to hold his or her breath during the test. The test subject then may be refitted and retested. 

(2) A record of the test shall be kept on file, assuming the fit test was successful. The record must contain the test subject's name; overall fit factor; make, model, style and size of respirator used; and date tested.[/expand]

[expand title="5. Controlled Negative Pressure (CNP) REDON Quantitative Fit Testing Protocol"]

(a) When administering this protocol to test subjects, employers must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (a) and (c) of Part I.C.4 of this appendix ("Controlled negative pressure (CNP) quantitative fit testing protocol"), as well as use the test exercises described below in paragraph (b) of this protocol instead of the test exercises specified in paragraph (b) of Part I.C.4 of this appendix. 

(b) Employers must ensure that each test subject being fit tested using this protocol follows the exercise and measurement procedures, including the order of administration, described below in Table A-1 of this appendix.

Table A-1. -- CNP REDON Quantitative Fit Testing Protocol
Exercises*

[table id=35 /]

*Exercises are listed in the order in which they are to be administered.

(c) After completing the test exercises, the test administrator must question each test subject regarding the comfort of the respirator. When a test subject states that the respirator is unacceptable, the employer must ensure that the test administrator repeats the protocol using another respirator model. 

(d) Employers must determine the overall fit factor for each test subject by calculating the harmonic mean of the fit testing exercises as follows: 

Overall Fit Factor = N / (1/FF1 + 1/FF2+ … 1/FFn)

Where:
N = The number of exercises;
FF1 = The fit factor for the first exercise;
FF2 = The fit factor for the second exercise; and
FFN = The fit factor for the nth exercise.[/expand]

[expand title="Part II. New Fit Test Protocols"]

A. Any person may submit to OSHA an application for approval of a new fit test protocol. If the application meets the following criteria, OSHA will initiate a rulemaking proceeding under section 6(b)(7) of the OSH Act to determine whether to list the new protocol as an approved protocol in this Appendix A. 

B. The application must include a detailed description of the proposed new fit test protocol. This application must be supported by either: 

1. A test report prepared by an independent government research laboratory (e.g., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, the National Institute for Standards and Technology) stating that the laboratory has tested the protocol and had found it to be accurate and reliable; or 

2. An article that has been published in a peer-reviewed industrial hygiene journal describing the protocol and explaining how test data support the protocol's accuracy and reliability. 

C. If OSHA determines that additional information is required before the Agency commences a rulemaking proceeding under this section, OSHA will so notify the applicant and afford the applicant the opportunity to submit the supplemental information. Initiation of a rulemaking proceeding will be deferred until OSHA has received and evaluated the supplemental information.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The individual who uses a tight-fitting respirator is to perform a user seal check to ensure that an adequate seal is achieved each time the respirator is put on. Either the positive and negative pressure checks listed in this appendix, or the respirator manufacturer's recommended user seal check method shall be used. User seal checks are not substitutes for qualitative or quantitative fit tests.

<strong>I. Facepiece Positive and/or Negative Pressure Checks</strong>

A. Positive pressure check. Close off the exhalation valve and exhale gently into the facepiece. The face fit is considered satisfactory if a slight positive pressure can be built up inside the facepiece without any evidence of outward leakage of air at the seal. For most respirators this method of leak testing requires the wearer to first remove the exhalation valve cover before closing off the exhalation valve and then carefully replacing it after the test.

B. Negative pressure check. Close off the inlet opening of the canister or cartridge(s) by covering with the palm of the hand(s) or by replacing the filter seal(s), inhale gently so that the facepiece collapses slightly, and hold the breath for ten seconds. The design of the inlet opening of some cartridges cannot be effectively covered with the palm of the hand. The test can be performed by covering the inlet opening of the cartridge with a thin latex or nitrile glove. If the facepiece remains in its slightly collapsed condition and no inward leakage of air is detected, the tightness of the respirator is considered satisfactory.

<strong>II. Manufacturer's Recommended User Seal Check Procedures</strong>

The respirator manufacturer's recommended procedures for performing a user seal check may be used instead of the positive and/or negative pressure check procedures provided that the employer demonstrates that the manufacturer's procedures are equally effective.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[These procedures are provided for employer use when cleaning respirators. They are general in nature, and the employer as an alternative may use the cleaning recommendations provided by the manufacturer of the respirators used by their employees, provided such procedures are as effective as those listed here in Appendix B- 2. Equivalent effectiveness simply means that the procedures used must accomplish the objectives set forth in Appendix B-2, i.e., must ensure that the respirator is properly cleaned and disinfected in a manner that prevents damage to the respirator and does not cause harm to the user.

<strong>I. Procedures for Cleaning Respirators</strong>

A. Remove filters, cartridges, or canisters. Disassemble facepieces by removing speaking diaphragms, demand and pressure- demand valve assemblies, hoses, or any components recommended by the manufacturer. Discard or repair any defective parts.

B. Wash components in warm (43 deg. C [110 deg. F] maximum) water with a mild detergent or with a cleaner recommended by the manufacturer. A stiff bristle (not wire) brush may be used to facilitate the removal of dirt.

C. Rinse components thoroughly in clean, warm (43 deg. C [110 deg. F] maximum), preferably running water. Drain.

D. When the cleaner used does not contain a disinfecting agent, respirator components should be immersed for two minutes in one of the following:

1. Hypochlorite solution (50 ppm of chlorine) made by adding approximately one milliliter of laundry bleach to one liter of water at 43 deg. C (110 deg. F); or,

2. Aqueous solution of iodine (50 ppm iodine) made by adding approximately 0.8 milliliters of tincture of iodine (6-8 grams ammonium and/or potassium iodide/100 cc of 45% alcohol) to one liter of water at 43 deg. C (110 deg. F); or,

3. Other commercially available cleansers of equivalent disinfectant quality when used as directed, if their use is recommended or approved by the respirator manufacturer.

E. Rinse components thoroughly in clean, warm (43 deg. C [110 deg. F] maximum), preferably running water. Drain. The importance of thorough rinsing cannot be overemphasized. Detergents or disinfectants that dry on facepieces may result in dermatitis. In addition, some disinfectants may cause deterioration of rubber or corrosion of metal parts if not completely removed.

F. Components should be hand-dried with a clean lint-free cloth or air-dried.

G. Reassemble facepiece, replacing filters, cartridges, and canisters where necessary.

H. Test the respirator to ensure that all components work properly.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Respirators must be used in workplaces in which employees are exposed to hazardous airborne contaminants. When respiratory protection is required employers must have a respirator protection program as specified in OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134). Before wearing a respirator, workers must first be medically evaluated using the mandatory medical questionnaire or an equivalent method. 

<a href="https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=9783">OSHA 1910.134, Appendix C</a> lists all the mandatory questions required in a medical evaluation. This questionnaire is also provided in an easier to use format in as an OSHA Infosheet at <a href="https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3789info.pdf">https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3789info.pdf</a>

<strong>Medical Evaluation and Questionnaire Requirements</strong>

•	The employer must identify a physician or other licensed health care professional (PLHCP) to perform all medical evaluations using the medical questionnaire in Appendix C of the Respiratory Protection standard or a medical examination that obtains the same information. (See Paragraph (e)(2)(i).)
•	The medical evaluation must obtain the information requested in Sections 1 and 2, Part A of Appendix C. The questions in Part B of Appendix C may be added at the discretion of the health care professional. (See Paragraph (e)(2)(ii).) 
•	The employer must ensure that a follow- up medical examination is provided for any employee who gives a positive response to any question among questions 1 through 8 in Part A Section 2, of Appendix C, or whose initial medical examination demonstrates the need for a follow-up medical examination. The employer must provide the employee with an opportunity to discuss the questionnaire and examination results with the PLHCP. (See Paragraph (e)(3)(i).) 
•	The medical questionnaire and examinations must be administered confidentially during the employee's normal working hours or at a time and place convenient to the employee and in a manner that ensures that he or she understands its content. The employer must not review the employee's responses, and the questionnaire must be provided directly to the PLHCP. (See Paragraph (e)(4)(i).)

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Respirators are an effective method of protection against designated hazards when properly selected and worn. Respirator use is encouraged, even when exposures are below the exposure limit, to provide an additional level of comfort and protection for workers. However, if a respirator is used improperly or not kept clean, the respirator itself can become a hazard to the worker. Sometimes, workers may wear respirators to avoid exposures to hazards, even if the amount of hazardous substance does not exceed the limits set by OSHA standards. If your employer provides respirators for your voluntary use, or if you provide your own respirator, you need to take certain precautions to be sure that the respirator itself does not present a hazard. 

<strong>You should do the following: </strong>

1. Read and heed all instructions provided by the manufacturer on use, maintenance, cleaning and care, and warnings regarding the respirators limitations. 

2. Choose respirators certified for use to protect against the contaminant of concern. NIOSH, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, certifies respirators. A label or statement of certification should appear on the respirator or respirator packaging. It will tell you what the respirator is designed for and how much it will protect you. 

3. Do not wear your respirator into atmospheres containing contaminants for which your respirator is not designed to protect against. For example, a respirator designed to filter dust particles will not protect you against gases, vapors, or very small solid particles of fumes or smoke. 

4. Keep track of your respirator so that you do not mistakenly use someone else's respirator.
