RESPIRATORS

	NPG states
		dust -> dust
		resp dust
		total dust -> total dust
		total -> total dust
		resp
		vapor
		other

	Z1 

		respirable fraction -> resp dust


MANUALLY FIX these and others

	Zinc oxide fume (moved)

	Magnesium oxide fume - Total Particulate (reshuffled)

	Tetrachloroethylene (fixed for now, until I add max peaks)

	ANTU

	"Uranium (soluble compounds, as U)" needs a CAS (reshuffled)

	Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated (PNOR)(i)	(added)

	Butadiene (1,3-Butadiene); See 29 CFR 1910.1051; 29 CFR 1910.19(l) (fixed, any ideas on how to interpret 1 ppm / 5 ppm STEL?)

	Benzene; See 1910.1028; See Table Z-2 for the limits applicable in the operations or sectors excluded in 1910.1028(j) (cleaned)

	Vanadium (how should we handle V/m3?)

	Silica, crystalline, respirable dust (all good nao)

	Talc (containing no asbestos and less than 1% quartz) (how do we handle mppcf?)




(DONE) asbestos needs f/cm3

(DONE) tert-butyl chromate

	needs to accept new units
	Cr(IV) is a NEW STATE, and units that refer to it are attached to that state
	add to name: (as CrO3)

(DONE) beryllium

	add general standard

(DONE) coal tar pitch volatiles -- "chrysene" is an alternate name, but the list of alternate names is so long it doesn't get matched

(DONE) FIX Chromium (VI) compounds ... weird notes

(DONE) Coal dust - split NPG notes out into two different states - > 5% 

	add notes to MESUREMENT DURATIONS

	split PEL out into the right states

	make MSHA PEL its own standard

	OSHA PEL

		one clickable TWA, one non-clickable TWA


(DONE) cotton dust

	needs to parse < symbol

	Raw and not-raw should remain separate

	link [Z-1-A &amp; 1910.1043]


(DONE) crotonaldehyde needs its second CAS number from the Z1

(DONE) Dinitrobenzene (all isomers)

	needs to send its values to its isomers (ALL 3, right now only2)

(DONE) Emery should have both CAS numbers, fron the NPG and Z1

(DONE) Ethylene needs to include < symbol, plus custom duration ceiling limit

	New measurement duration class, "excursion"

(DONE) Z1 parsing correction: '........' means its blank

(DONE) Iron oxide - Z1 merge with NPG

	separate states - "dust and fume" and "fume"

(DONE) 2-Methoxyethanol; (Methyl cellosolve) - GET RID OF SEMICOLON SO IT DOESN'T STRIP THE REST

(???) Nickel, metal and insoluble compounds (as Ni) - merge with Nickel metal and other compounds (as Ni), split out metal/insoluble into separate states

(DONE) Nitrotoluene (all isomers) needs to cascade down cal/osha pel

(DONE) paraquat - probably need to ignore

(DONE) silica, armorphous - support mppcf

(DONE) silica, crystalline -- quartz: has a colon which it shouldn't

(DONE) titanium dioxide
	
	add states

		2.4 mg/m3 (fine)
		0.3 mg/m3 (ultrafine)

(DONE) Uranium (soluble compounds, as U)

	remove ,

(DONE) Chromic acid and chromates (Z37-7-1971)

	(as Cr) needs to be a state

(DONE) Hydrogen fluoride (Z37.28-1969)

	"as F" gets its own state from the Z2

(DONE) (check) Vanadium dust

	add unit V/m3, V2O5/m3

	vanadium pentoxide should be a state

	"respirable dust v2o5" should be a state for the OSHA PEL NPG

(DONE) (ckeck) Vanadium fume

	merge NPG and z1 OSHA PELS (same thing)


(???) 1,1,2-Trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane (and others)

	Ceiling is at the bottom of durations

(DONE) (check, merged with NPG Tin) Tin, inorganic compounds (except oxides) (as Sn)

	remove semicolon

	SnH4 should be proper

(DONE) Thallium (soluble compounds, as Tl) <-> Thallium, soluble compounds (as Tl)

(DONE) Nitroglycerine

	CAL gets new state for the TWA

(DONE) Methyl CellosolveÂ® acetate <-> 2-Methoxyethyl acetate (Methyl cellosolve acetate)

(DONE) Graphite (synthetic) <-> Graphite, synthetic

(DONE) copper -- merge with fumes and dusts and mists

(DONE) Chromium (II) compounds (as Cr) <-> Chromium(II) compounds (as Cr)

(DONE) Chromium (III) compounds (as Cr) <-> Chromium(III) compounds (as Cr)

(DONE check) carbon black
	
	Ca not picking uponate

	new state: in presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)

	and new unit

(DONE) Calcium hydroxide

	redundant note

(DONE) 1,3-Butadiene

	redundant note

(DONE) Talc (containing asbestos and less than 1% crystalline silica)

	sources should be blank if there are no sources

(DONE) cyhexatin

(DONE) chromyl chloride


chemicals

	note issue
		N-Phenyl-beta-naphthylamine
		2-Nitronaphthalene

	[skin] needs to be handled like Carcinogenic

	aniline and homologs
		(aniline only) should be a state

	Tetrachloroethylene
		string duration on EL

	tert-Butyl chromate (as CrO3)
		notes didn't come  through on OSHA PEL
		cal osha pel needs to have cro3 as a state

	vanadium dust (as v2o5), vanadium fume
		custom units everywhere they occur in the NPG

	RTECS fix
		Calcium carbonate
		Subtilisins
		Toluenediamine

	Titanium dioxide - Total dust
		notes???

	molybdenum

		osha pel note goes with default state
		cal osha pel (Insoluble Compounds) needs to be (Insoluble Compounds - Respirable dust)

	arsine!!??


my info stuff
	
	mandatory respirator for some selections - needs to be shown on jobs






Acetaldehyde
