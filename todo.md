RESPIRATORS

	NPG states
		dust -> dust
		resp dust
		total dust -> total dust
		total -> total dust
		resp
		vapor
		other

	Z1 

		respirable fraction -> resp dust


MANUALLY FIX these and others

	Zinc oxide fume (moved)

	Magnesium oxide fume - Total Particulate (reshuffled)

	Tetrachloroethylene (fixed for now, until I add max peaks)

	ANTU

	"Uranium (soluble compounds, as U)" needs a CAS (reshuffled)

	Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated (PNOR)(i)	(added)

	Butadiene (1,3-Butadiene); See 29 CFR 1910.1051; 29 CFR 1910.19(l) (fixed, any ideas on how to interpret 1 ppm / 5 ppm STEL?)

	Benzene; See 1910.1028; See Table Z-2 for the limits applicable in the operations or sectors excluded in 1910.1028(j) (cleaned)

	Vanadium (how should we handle V/m3?)

	Silica, crystalline, respirable dust (all good nao)

	Talc (containing no asbestos and less than 1% quartz) (how do we handle mppcf?)


MAX PEAK: exception to ceiling limit.  Is ATTACHED to ceiling limit, visually and structurally.  Do we even need to do something special with this?  Gonna leave it for now.
